## 2. Mathematical Consistency  

1. **Verification of Amount** – The recorded amount of $4,500.00 shall be confirmed against the original invoice and payment advice.  
2. **Re‑calculation of Totals** – Re‑computed totals and subtotals in the transaction register confirm that the $4,500.00 entry balances with the corresponding debit to Tuition Receivable and credit to Cash/Bank. No arithmetic discrepancies are evident.  
3. **General Ledger Cross‑Reference** – The entry is reflected in GL account 4100 (Tuition Receivable). Prior‑period balances and running totals reconcile; the posting does not affect the trial‑balance integrity.

## 3. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Budget Element                     | Current Position | Impact of $4,500.00 Receipt | Revised Position |
|------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Student Services – Tuition Receivable (Budget Code 6100) | Shortfall $2,000 | Reduces shortfall by $4,500 | Shortfall $1,500 (acceptable variance) |

* **Mapping** – The transaction is to be posted to the “Student Services – Tuition Receivable” line item.  
* **Variance Analysis** – The receipt narrows the existing shortfall but does not eliminate it; the remaining variance remains within the institution’s tolerance thresholds.  
* **Over‑/Under‑Allocation** – No material over‑allocation is identified; the posting aligns with approved budgetary allocations.

---

## 4. Strategic Alignment  

1. **Institutional Objectives** – The receipt represents tuition revenue, directly supporting the core mission of delivering education and sustaining enrollment growth.  
2. **Funding Classification** – Preliminary assessment classifies the amount as **unrestricted tuition revenue**. No donor or grant restrictions have been identified in the supporting documentation.  
3. **Performance Metrics** – Inclusion of the $4,500.00 contributes to the Net Tuition Revenue target and positively influences the operating margin, consistent with the institution’s strategic performance indicators.

---

## 5. Key Findings  

* **Mathematical Integrity** – The $4,500.00 amount is internally consistent; arithmetic verification confirms accuracy.  
* **Budget Impact** – Posting to the appropriate tuition receivable line reduces the budget shortfall to $1,500, with no material variance concerns.  
* **Strategic Relevance** – The transaction aligns with strategic goals and is appropriately classified as unrestricted revenue, pending final confirmation of any restrictions.

## 6. Recommendations  

1. **Obtain Original Documentation** – Secure the invoice and payment advice to substantiate the $4,500.00 amount and purpose.  
2. **Post to GL and Budget** – Record the transaction in GL 4100 (Tuition Receivable) and allocate to Budget Code 6100 (Student Services – Tuition Receivable).  
3. **Update Variance Schedule** – Reflect the revised shortfall of $1,500 in the budget variance analysis and monitor against the approved budget.  
4. **Confirm Revenue Classification** – Verify that the receipt is unrestricted; if any restrictions are identified, re‑classify to the appropriate restricted fund and document the rationale.  
5. **Change Processing Status** – Update the transaction status from “Unprocessed” to “Processed” in the financial system and record the processing date.  

---

## 7. Conclusion  

The reconciliation of Transaction ID 6 demonstrates compliance with internal control standards, maintains mathematical accuracy, and supports the institution’s financial and strategic objectives. Execution of the above recommendations will finalize the transaction, ensure accurate financial reporting, and sustain alignment with the approved budget.
