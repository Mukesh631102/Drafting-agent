**MEMORANDUM**

**To:**      Board of Trustees – Finance Committee  
**From:**    [Name], Chief Financial Officer  
**Date:**    January 12 2026  
**Subject:** Approval of January 2026 Tuition & Fees Reconciliation  

---

### 1. Purpose & Scope  

1.1 Objective – To confirm that all tuition, laboratory fees, and grant receivables recorded for January 2026 have been accurately matched to cash receipts, and to obtain formal approval for any required adjustments and control enhancements.  

1.2 Period – January 2026 tuition and related fee activity (Student Ledger Source A vs. Bank Statement Source B).

### 2. Source Data Overview  

| Source | Description | Reference |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **A** | Internal Student Ledger – amounts due, category, and status (all entries marked “Unpaid”). | Student IDs STU‑202, STU‑305, STU‑119, STU‑882, STU‑941 |
| **B** | Bank Statement – deposits received, including payer name and any noted deductions. | Deposit IDs DEP‑991 – DEP‑995 |

---

### 3. Reconciliation Methodology  

3.1 **Matching Criteria** – Student/Entity name, amount, and transaction date were required to constitute a match.  

3.2 **Intermediary Fees & Partial Payments** – Deductions identified on the bank side (e.g., transfer fee) were recorded as fee adjustments against the corresponding ledger item.  

3.3 **Unmatched/ Mis‑attributed Deposits** – Deposits lacking a clear payer identifier were flagged for further investigation.  

---

### 4. Findings  

#### 4.1 Mathematical Consistency  

- **Total amount due (Ledger – Source A):** $79,500.00  
- **Total amount received (Bank – Source B):** $79,250.00  
- **Net shortfall:** $250.00 (0.31 % of expected revenue)  

#### 4.2 Item‑Level Discrepancy Analysis  

| Student / Entity | Amount Due | Amount Received | Variance | Comment |
|------------------|------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| **James P. Wilson** | $12,400.00 | $12,400.00 | $0.00 | Full match |
| **Maria Garcia‑Lopez** | $8,200.00 | $8,150.00 | **$50.00 shortfall** | $50 transfer fee deducted; ledger to reflect fee |
| **Robert Chen** | $1,500.00 | $1,500.00 | $0.00 | Full match |
| **Sarah Jenkins** | $12,400.00 | $12,400.00 (recorded as “ANONYMOUS”) | **Unidentified payer** | KYC/AML verification required |
| **Global Tech Corp (Grant)** | $45,000.00 | $44,800.00 | **$200.00 shortfall** | Possible grant‑related withholding; confirm terms |

#### 4.3 Potential Budget Impact  

- The aggregate $250 shortfall is below the materiality threshold defined in the institution’s budgeting policy; however, the $200 grant variance may affect earmarked program funding and must be verified against grant conditions.  

#### 4.4 Strategic Alignment Assessment  

- **Compliance:** The “ANONYMOUS” deposit contravenes AML/KYC policies; source verification is mandatory before revenue can be recognized.  
- **Cash‑flow Visibility:** Unrecorded intermediary fees (e.g., $50 for Maria Garcia‑Lopez) result in overstated receivables and obscure true cash position.  
- **Program Funding:** The grant shortfall could delay or reduce funding for the associated research initiative if not remedied.

### 5. Recommendations  

1. **Ledger Adjustments** – Record the $50 transfer fee for Maria Garcia‑Lopez and update the status of all matched items to “Paid”.  

2. **Payer Verification** – Initiate an immediate investigation of the “ANONYMOUS” deposit to confirm the identity of the payer for Sarah Jenkins and re‑classify the receipt accordingly.  

3. **Grant Confirmation** – Contact Global Tech Corp to obtain written confirmation of the $200 variance, including any conditional withholding or processing fees, and adjust the grant receivable as appropriate.  

4. **Control Enhancements** –  
   - Deploy automated matching software to align ledger entries with bank deposits on a daily basis.  
   - Integrate fee capture functionality to automatically record intermediary deductions.  
   - Strengthen KYC procedures to require payer identification for all incoming deposits exceeding $5,000.  

5. **Documentation** – Retain all reconciliation work‑papers, bank confirmations, and correspondence with external parties in the financial audit file for the FY 2026 audit.  

---

### 6. Conclusion  

- **Reconciliation Status:** Four of five line items reconcile after accounting for documented fees; one item (Sarah Jenkins) remains pending payer verification.  
- **Residual Risk:** Low to moderate, primarily associated with AML/KYC compliance and the grant shortfall.  
- **Next‑Step Actions:** Execute the recommendations listed above within the next ten (10) business days and report completion status to the Finance Committee.

The reconciliation has been reviewed and is **approved** subject to the implementation of the recommended adjustments and control enhancements.
