**Period Covered:** 5 January 2026 – 12 January 2026

**Prepared For:** Chief Financial Officer, Finance Division  
**Date:** 15 January 2026

### I. Introduction  

**Objective** – To verify that all tuition‑related receivables recorded in the internal tuition ledger (Source A) are reflected in the bank deposit statement (Source B) for the period 5 Jan 2026 – 12 Jan 2026, and to identify and explain any variances.  

**Scope** – Reconciliation of five tuition‑related entries, including a scholarship and an ancillary laboratory fee, recorded in the internal ledger and the corresponding cash deposits.

---

### II. Data Sources  

| Source | Description | Key Fields |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **A – Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual)** | Pending tuition charges as of 5‑10 Jan 2026 | Student/Entity ID, Name, Fee, Status |
| **B – Bank Deposit Statement (Cash)** | Cash receipts posted on 12 Jan 2026 | Deposit Ref., Payer, Amount, Notes |

---

### III. Reconciliation Methodology  

1. **Matching Criteria** – Exact dollar amount, payer name/initials, and date proximity.  
2. **Procedure** –  
   a. Align each ledger record with a deposit entry.  
   b. Flag any amount mismatches, unidentified payers, or missing deposits.  
   c. Document the nature of each variance (e.g., bank fees, unidentified payers).

### IV. Matching Summary  

| Ledger ID | Ledger Name | Ledger Fee | Deposit Ref. | Deposit Payer | Deposit Amount | Match Status |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| STU‑8821 | James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | ✅ Matched |
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | ⚠️ Discrepancy |
| STU‑4410 | TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | TechCorp | $12,000.00 | ✅ Matched |
| STU‑1125 | Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | R. Chen | $5,400.00 | ✅ Matched |
| STU‑5501 | Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | UNKNOWN | $2,100.00 | ✅ Matched (see Section V‑B) |

### V. Discrepancy Analysis  

#### A. Maria Garcia – $50.00 Shortfall  

- **Observed variance:** Ledger amount $5,400.00 vs. deposit $5,350.00.  
- **Root cause:** Deposit note indicates “Wire Fee Deducted.”  
- **Interpretation:** The $50.00 represents a bank‑imposed wire‑transfer fee; the receivable remains $5,400.00, while cash received is $5,350.00. The fee will be recorded as a bank‑service expense.

#### B. STU‑5501 (Sarah Jenkins) – “UNKNOWN” Deposit  

- **Ledger description:** Lab fee of $2,100.00 (ancillary, non‑tuition).  
- **Deposit observation:** Payer listed as “UNKNOWN” but amount matches exactly.  
- **Explanation:** The payment was likely made via cash or a third‑party channel that did not capture the payer’s name in the bank reference field. The exact amount confirms receipt; however, the lack of payer identification constitutes a control weakness that requires remediation.

### VI. Missing Entries  

All five ledger entries have corresponding deposit records, and no deposit entries lack a matching ledger record. No missing or duplicate entries were identified.

---

### VII. Mathematical Consistency Review  

| Category | Total Ledger (Accrual) | Total Deposited (Cash) | Net Variance |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Tuition & Scholarship | $28,200.00 | $28,150.00 | **‑$50.00** (wire fee) |
| Lab Fee (Ancillary) | $2,100.00 | $2,100.00 | $0.00 |
| **Combined Total** | **$30,300.00** | **$30,250.00** | **‑$50.00** |

*The sole $50.00 variance is attributable to the wire‑transfer fee on Maria Garcia’s payment; no unrecorded amounts exist.*

---

### VIII. Budget Impact Assessment  

1. **Revenue Recognition** – Accrual tuition revenue remains $30,300.00. Cash inflow is $30,250.00; the $50.00 fee reduces cash availability but does not affect recognized revenue.  
2. **Cash‑Flow Planning** – Forecasts should incorporate typical wire‑transfer fees (0.5 % – 1 % of tuition receipts) to avoid overstating net cash.  
3. **Ancillary Fee Tracking** – The “UNKNOWN” payer for the lab fee highlights a control deficiency that may affect cost‑recovery analysis for laboratory resources.

---

### IX. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

| Consideration | Observation | Alignment Implication |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Tuition Collection Policy | All tuition charges captured; ancillary fee lacks payer detail. | Consistent with policy; recommend enhancement of deposit tagging for ancillary fees. |
| Scholarship Accounting | TechCorp scholarship fully recorded and deposited. | Aligns with scholarship disbursement controls. |
| Bank Fee Management | Single wire fee incurred. | Suggest negotiation of fee‑free electronic payment options to improve net cash yield. |
| Data Integrity | No missing or duplicate entries identified. | Supports reliable financial reporting and audit readiness. |

### X. Conclusions & Recommendations  

1. **Record Wire‑Fee Expense** – Debit *Bank Service Charges* $50.00; credit *Cash* $50.00. Adjust cash‑flow projections accordingly.  
2. **Standardize Deposit References** – Implement a mandatory reference format (e.g., “STU‑#### – Student Name”) for all payments, including ancillary fees, to eliminate “UNKNOWN” entries.  
3. **Monitor Transaction Fees** – Conduct quarterly reviews of bank‑imposed fees on tuition collections; evaluate alternative payment channels to reduce expense.  
4. **Document Retention** – File this reconciliation worksheet, supporting schedules, and the journal entry for the wire fee in the permanent audit trail.
