### 1. INTRODUCTION  

#### 1.1 Purpose of Reconciliation Review  
To verify the accuracy, completeness, and proper accounting treatment of the transaction recorded under ID 45 (“ALICE J – Q1 FEES”) and to assess its conformity with budgetary allocations, institutional revenue policies, and internal control requirements.  

#### 1.2 Scope and Limitations

The analysis does not incorporate external audit findings or subsequent cash‑receipt confirmations beyond the scope of this report.

### 3. MATHEMATICAL CONSISTENCY REVIEW  

#### 3.1 Verification of Recorded Amount vs. Source Document  
- The recorded amount of **$5,000.00** is internally consistent with the transaction entry.  
- Confirmation against the original invoice or enrollment agreement is required to substantiate the figure.  

#### 3.2 Currency Specification and Rounding Precision  
- The transaction is denominated in U.S. dollars; no currency conversion is applicable.  
- Amount is expressed to two decimal places; no rounding discrepancies identified.  

#### 3.3 Integrity of Transaction Identifier and Reference Fields  
- Transaction ID 45 is unique within the current accounting period.  
- Payer name matches the enrollment record for “Alice J” for Q1 fees.  

**Finding:** Mathematical integrity is satisfactory pending source‑document verification.  

---

### 4. BUDGET DISCREPANCY ASSESSMENT  

#### 4.1 Comparison to Approved Q1‑Fee Budget Allocation  
- The approved Q1‑fee budget line for “Alice J” has not been retrieved at the time of this review.  

#### 4.2 Variance Analysis (Over‑/Under‑Budget)  
- Without the approved budget figure, variance cannot be quantified.  
- A variance threshold of **5 %** is established; any deviation exceeding this threshold shall trigger a detailed investigation.  

#### 4.3 Impact on Period‑End Budgetary Controls and Forecasts  
- Unprocessed status delays revenue recognition, potentially distorting period‑end financial statements and cash‑flow forecasts.  

**Finding:** Budgetary alignment cannot be confirmed; retrieval of the approved budget line is required.  

---

### 5. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT EVALUATION (EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION CONTEXT)  

#### 5.1 Alignment with Institutional Revenue Objectives  
- Assuming the fee represents a standard quarterly tuition charge, the transaction contributes directly to the institution’s core revenue stream.  

#### 5.2 Contribution to Funding of Core Academic Programs and Student Services  
- Quarterly tuition revenue underpins the financing of instructional delivery, faculty support, and student services for the applicable term.  

#### 5.3 Compliance with Institutional Fee Policies and Tuition Schedules  
- Alignment is contingent upon the fee amount matching the tuition schedule approved by the Board of Trustees and the payer’s enrollment status.  

**Finding:** Strategic relevance is affirmed, subject to verification of fee policy compliance.
