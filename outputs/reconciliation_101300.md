## 1. Executive Summary  

The reconciliation of tuition receivables recorded on the internal accrual ledger (Source A) to cash deposits reflected in the bank statement (Source B) for the period 5‑12 January 2026 demonstrates full mathematical consistency. A single variance of **$50.00** is fully explained by a bank‑imposed wire‑transfer fee. All five tuition items have corresponding cash receipts; the only outstanding issue is an “UNKNOWN” payer designation for a lab‑fee deposit, which requires further documentation to ensure proper revenue attribution.

---

## 2. Objective & Scope  

- **Objective:** Verify that every tuition receivable posted in the internal accrual ledger is represented in the bank deposit register and quantify any variances.  
- **Scope:** Tuition items (including a lab fee) recorded between 5 January 2026 and 10 January 2026 (Source A) and deposit entries dated 12 January 2026 (Source B).

## 3. Data Sources  

| Source | Description | Record Count |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Source A** | Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual) – pending tuition items | 5 |
| **Source B** | Bank Deposit Statement (Cash) – deposit entries | 5 |

---

## 4. Reconciliation Methodology  

- **Matching Criteria:** Student ID (or scholarship identifier), name, invoiced fee amount, and deposit amount.  
- **Exception Handling:**  
  - Bank‑deducted wire‑transfer fees recorded separately.  
  - Deposits with “UNKNOWN” payer flagged for investigation.

## 5. Matching Summary  

| Source A (ID/Name)                     | Ledger Amount | Source B (Reference) | Deposit Amount | Match Status |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| STU‑8821 – James Wilson                 | $5,400.00     | DEP‑001 – J. Wilson  | $5,400.00      | Exact match |
| STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia                 | $5,400.00     | DEP‑002 – Maria Garcia| $5,350.00      | Partial match (‑$50) |
| STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship         | $12,000.00    | DEP‑003 – TechCorp    | $12,000.00     | Exact match |
| STU‑1125 – Robert Chen                  | $5,400.00     | DEP‑004 – R. Chen    | $5,400.00      | Exact match |
| STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee)     | $2,100.00     | DEP‑005 – UNKNOWN    | $2,100.00      | Amount match; payer unknown |

## 6. Detailed Findings  

### 6.1. $50 Discrepancy – Maria Garcia  
- **Ledger amount:** $5,400.00  
- **Deposit amount:** $5,350.00 (annotated “Wire Fee Deducted”)  
- **Root cause:** Bank‑imposed wire‑transfer fee of $50.00.  

### 6.2. “UNKNOWN” Deposit – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee)  
- **Ledger amount:** $2,100.00 (lab fee)  
- **Deposit amount:** $2,100.00 (payer field blank/UNKNOWN)  
- **Potential explanations:**  
  1. Cash payment without proper identification.  
  2. Third‑party sponsor payment not captured in the payer field.  
  3. Data‑entry omission.  

### 6.3. Missing Entries  
- No tuition items from Source A are absent in Source B.  
- All five ledger items have corresponding cash receipts; variances are limited to the $50 fee and the unidentified payer.

## 7. Mathematical Consistency Review  

| Description                | Amount (USD) |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Total Accrued Tuition (Source A)** | $30,300.00 |
| **Total Deposited Cash (Source B)**  | $30,250.00 |
| **Net Variance**                     | **($50.00)** |

The net variance of **$50.00** corresponds precisely to the documented wire‑transfer fee for Maria Garcia.

---

## 8. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

- **Wire‑Transfer Fee Impact:** Reduces net cash inflow; must be recorded as a banking expense or an adjustment to tuition receivable to preserve budget integrity.  
- **Unidentified Payer for Lab Fee:** May affect departmental revenue attribution and compliance with scholarship‑tracking requirements; risk of misstatement in source‑of‑funds reporting.  

---

## 9. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

- **Revenue Recognition:** Accrual records are accurate; cash receipts substantiate tuition revenue, supporting reliable financial statements.  
- **Cash‑Flow Management:** The $50 fee is immaterial but highlights the need for a policy on handling bank‑deducted fees.  
- **Compliance & Reporting:** Unidentified payer entries could impede compliance with grant‑or scholarship‑tracking mandates; corrective action enhances transparency and audit readiness.  

---

## 10. Recommendations  

1. **Record Wire‑Fee**  
   - Debit **Bank Fees – Wire Transfer** $50.00  
   - Credit **Tuition Receivable – Maria Garcia** $50.00  

2. **Investigate “UNKNOWN” Deposit**  
   - Obtain supporting documentation (cash receipt slip, sponsor letter, or internal memo) to correctly classify the payer for Sarah Jenkins’ lab fee.  

3. **Enhance Payment Capture Controls**  
   - Mandate completion of the payer reference field for all deposit entries.  
   - Implement a reconciliation checklist that flags any “UNKNOWN” or fee‑deducted deposits for immediate review.  

4. **Periodic Variance Analysis**  
   - Conduct monthly variance reviews to capture recurring bank fees or payer‑identification issues early.  

5. **Documentation of Exceptions**  
   - Maintain a register of all bank‑deducted fees and unidentified payer incidents, including resolution status, for audit trail purposes.  

---

## 11. Conclusion  

The tuition‑revenue reconciliation for the period 5‑12 January 2026 confirms overall mathematical consistency. The sole variance of $50.00 is fully explained by a bank wire‑transfer fee. The “UNKNOWN” payer designation for the lab‑fee deposit requires further investigation to ensure accurate revenue attribution and compliance with reporting standards. Adoption of the recommended controls will strengthen cash‑receipt tracking, mitigate future variances, and reinforce alignment with institutional financial policies.
