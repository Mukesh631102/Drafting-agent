**Reconciliation Report**  
Report No.: 2026‑001  
Date: January 16 2026  

**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer Office  
**Subject:** Reconciliation of Transaction ID 23 – “MISC DEPOSIT SCHOOL”  

---

### 1. Executive Summary  

**Purpose** – To verify the completeness, accuracy, and proper classification of transaction ID 23 (a $100.00 deposit recorded as “unprocessed”) and to assess its impact on period‑end financial statements, cash‑flow projections, and budget variance.  

**Scope** – Review of transaction details, source‑document verification, mathematical validation, budgetary impact analysis, alignment with institutional accounting policies, risk assessment, and recommendation of corrective actions.  

---

### 2. Data Verification  

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **2.1 Transaction Identification** | ID = 23 |
| **2.2 Payer Verification** | Payer = “MISC DEPOSIT SCHOOL”; verified against the payer master file and deposit register. |
| **2.3 Amount Confirmation** | Amount = $100.00; confirmed by bank‑statement extract showing a $100.00 credit to the institution’s cash account. |
| **2.4 Status Review** | Current status = “unprocessed”, indicating the entry has not been posted to the general ledger. |

---

### 3. Mathematical Consistency  

**3.1 Arithmetic Validation** – The recorded amount of $100.00 contains no rounding or calculation errors.  

**3.2 Cross‑Reference** – The deposit appears in the cash‑receipts subsidiary ledger and matches the $100.00 credit on the bank statement.  

**3.3 General Ledger Reconciliation** – The $100.00 credit is absent from the trial balance due to its “unprocessed” status, creating a timing variance of $100.00.  

---

### 4. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

**4.1 Budget Comparison** – The “Miscellaneous Deposits” line item was budgeted at $0.00 for the period; the $100.00 deposit represents a +$100.00 variance.  

**4.2 Cash‑Flow Impact** – Inclusion of the deposit raises period‑end cash‑flow projections by $100.00; omission would understate cash availability.  

**4.3 Timing Variance** – The “unprocessed” status postpones recognition to the subsequent reporting period, potentially distorting period‑end cash balances.  

**4.4 Documentation Gap** – No deposit slip or electronic receipt is attached to the transaction file, constituting a control weakness.  

---

### 5. Strategic Alignment for an Educational Institution  

**5.1 Chart‑of‑Accounts Classification** – Recommended posting to “Miscellaneous Receivables – Non‑Revenue Deposits” (Account No. 4‑2000).  

**5.2 Funding‑Policy Alignment** – Classification complies with institutional policy that non‑revenue deposits be recorded as receivables until cleared.  

**5.3 Operational Relevance** – The deposit does not fund instructional or capital initiatives; accurate recording nonetheless supports transparent financial stewardship.  

**5.4 Risk Analysis** –  
- **Control Weakness:** Absence of supporting documentation increases risk of misstatement or fraud.  
- **Potential Misstatement:** Timing variance may affect cash‑flow reporting and budget variance analysis.  

---

### 6. Recommendations & Action Items  

| Action | Responsibility | Target Date |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **6.1 Process Transaction** – Post the $100.00 credit to the general ledger and attach supporting documentation (deposit slip or electronic receipt). | CFO Office | Immediate |
| **6.2 Update Budget Variance Schedule** – Record a +$100.00 variance under “Miscellaneous Deposits” and adjust cash‑flow forecasts. | Controller | Within 2 business days |
| **6.3 Ensure Proper Account Coding** – Apply Account No. 4‑2000 and verify consistency across reporting modules. | Finance Manager | Immediate |
| **6.4 Implement Control Checkpoint** – Establish a daily review of all “unprocessed” cash receipts; require documentation before posting. | Internal Audit | Within 5 business days |

---

### 7. Conclusion  

The $100.00 deposit is mathematically accurate but remains operationally incomplete. Prompt processing, documentation, and the implementation of a control checkpoint will eliminate the timing variance, strengthen internal controls, and align the transaction with budgetary and strategic objectives.
