### 1. Scope & Objectives  

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Comparison of the Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual) – *Source A* – with the Bank Deposit Statement – *Source B* – for the period 5‑10 Jan 2026 (ledger) and the deposit date 12 Jan 2026. |
| **Objectives** | 1. Align each ledger entry with its corresponding bank deposit.<br>2. Quantify and explain all monetary variances.<br>3. Identify deposits lacking payer identification.<br>4. Detect any missing or unrecorded entries.<br>5. Assess mathematical consistency, budget impact, and strategic alignment. |

### 2. Matching Summary  

| Ledger ID | Student / Entity | Ledger Fee | Deposit Ref | Payer on Deposit | Deposit Amount | Reconciliation Status |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| STU‑8821 | James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | Fully reconciled |
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | Partial – $50.00 fee |
| STU‑4410 | TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | TechCorp | $12,000.00 | Fully reconciled |
| STU‑1125 | Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | R. Chen | $5,400.00 | Fully reconciled |
| STU‑5501 | Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | **UNKNOWN** | $2,100.00 | Partial – payer not identified |

---

### 3. Discrepancy Analysis  

#### 3.1 Maria Garcia – $50.00 Variance  
- **Root Cause:** The bank applied a wire‑transfer fee of $50.00, reducing the net deposit to $5,350.00. The internal ledger records the gross tuition amount ($5,400.00) and does not net bank fees.  
- **Financial Impact:** Cash receipt is $50.00 lower than the billed tuition; the amount must be recorded as a banking expense.

#### 3.2 Sarah Jenkins – “UNKNOWN” Payer  
- **Observation:** Deposit amount ($2,100.00) matches the lab‑fee charge recorded in the ledger.  
- **Inference:** The payer name was omitted from the bank’s reference field, likely due to a data‑entry oversight. The transaction is otherwise complete and correctly valued.

---

### 4. Missing / Unrecorded Entries  

- **Ledger → Deposit:** All five tuition ledger items have a corresponding deposit entry.  
- **Deposit → Ledger:** No deposit lacks a matching ledger record.  
- **Conclusion:** No missing or unrecorded entries were identified for the reconciliation period.

### 5. Mathematical Consistency  

| Source | Total Amount |
|--------|--------------|
| **Ledger (Source A)** | $30,300.00 |
| **Bank Deposits (Source B)** | $30,250.00 |
| **Net Variance** | **‑$50.00** (explained by Maria Garcia’s wire‑transfer fee) |

The variance is fully accounted for; no unexplained differences remain.

---

### 6. Budget & Cash‑Flow Implications  

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Bank‑Fee Expense ($50.00)** | Reduces net tuition revenue; must be reflected in cash‑flow forecasts and expense reporting. |
| **Unidentified Payer (Lab Fee)** | Hinders precise tracking of ancillary revenue streams; may affect internal reporting and external audit compliance. |

---

### 7. Strategic Alignment Considerations  

| Issue | Strategic Impact | Recommended Action |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| Unrecorded bank fees | Obscures true net tuition revenue; can distort budgeting and performance metrics. | Establish a dedicated “Bank Fees” expense line in the tuition‑revenue ledger; reconcile fees each cycle. |
| Missing payer identification (lab fee) | Reduces traceability of ancillary income; may affect grant or scholarship reporting requirements. | Enforce mandatory payer identification on all deposits; revise bank reference conventions accordingly. |
| Reconciliation timeliness | Delayed variance detection can impair cash‑management decisions. | Implement a daily or weekly reconciliation schedule for tuition receipts. |

---

### 8. Recommendations (Audit‑Ready)  

1. **Record Bank Fees** – Create a separate expense account for bank‑related deductions and adjust the tuition‑revenue ledger to reflect net cash received.  
2. **Enhance Deposit Documentation** – Finance staff must verify and, where necessary, amend bank deposit references to include payer names, especially for ancillary fees (e.g., lab fees).  
3. **Update Internal Controls** – Adopt a reconciliation checklist that flags any deposit amount differing from the billed amount by more than $0.01.  
4. **Periodic Review** – Conduct monthly reconciliation reviews; report recurring fee patterns to Treasury for potential negotiation of lower bank‑transfer costs.  

---

### 9. Key Findings  

- **Complete Matching:** All five ledger entries are represented in the bank statement; variances are limited to a $50.00 wire fee and an unidentified payer.  
- **$50.00 Discrepancy:** Attributable to a bank‑deducted wire‑transfer fee on Maria Garcia’s payment.  
- **“UNKNOWN” Deposit:** Amount aligns with Sarah Jenkins’ lab fee; payer omission is a documentation issue.  
- **Mathematical Consistency:** Ledger total $30,300.00 vs. deposit total $30,250.00; variance fully explained.  
- **No Missing Entries:** No tuition items are absent from the bank statement, and no deposits lack a ledger counterpart.  
- **Budget Impact:** Net cash receipt is $50.00 lower than billed tuition; bank fees should be recorded as an expense.  
- **Strategic Alignment:** Accurate reconciliation underpins financial integrity, cash‑flow planning, and compliance with reporting standards.

### 10. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that tuition receivables for the period 5 Jan 2026 – 12 Jan 2026 are materially accurate, with the only variances arising from a documented bank fee and a payer‑identification omission. Implementation of the recommended controls will eliminate similar variances in future cycles and enhance the reliability of financial reporting.
