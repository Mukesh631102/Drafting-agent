# Financial Reconciliation Report – Tuition Receivables  
**Period Covered:** January 5 – 12 2026  
**Report Date:** January 18 2026  

Prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and applicable professional auditing standards.  

---  

## 1. Executive Summary  

A complete reconciliation of the internal tuition ledger (Source A) to the bank deposit statement (Source B) was performed for the period January 5‑12 2026. All five tuition‑related entries were identified and matched. The reconciliation revealed:

* A $50 shortfall on the Maria Garcia payment attributable to a wire‑transfer fee.  
* An “UNKNOWN” deposit of $2,100 that corresponds to the lab‑fee invoice for Sarah Jenkins (STU‑5501).  
* No missing tuition or scholarship items; all pending ledger items should be re‑classified to “Paid” after adjustments.  

The net effect on tuition revenue is a $50 reduction, recorded as a bank‑fee expense.

## 2. Scope & Objectives  

1. **Match** each tuition ledger record (Source A) to its corresponding bank deposit (Source B).  
2. **Quantify** the $50 variance for Maria Garcia.  
3. **Explain** the “UNKNOWN” deposit of $2,100 and confirm its linkage to Sarah Jenkins (STU‑5501).  
4. **Identify** any missing or unmatched entries.  
5. **Assess** mathematical consistency, budget impact, and alignment with institutional strategic objectives.

## 3. Methodology  

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data Extraction** | All records from the internal tuition ledger (Source A) and the bank deposit statement (Source B) were transcribed into a reconciliation worksheet. |
| **Cross‑Reference Matching** | Payer name, invoice amount, and reference identifiers were used to align ledger entries with deposit records. |
| **Variance Analysis** | Differences between ledger amounts and deposit amounts were calculated; supporting notes (e.g., wire‑fee deduction) were examined. |
| **Control Review** | The adequacy of payer identification procedures and the status‑update process for pending items were evaluated. |

## 4. Reconciliation Findings  

| **Source A – Ledger** | **Source B – Deposit** | **Status** | **Variance** | **Comments** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| STU‑8821 – James Wilson – $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 – J. Wilson – $5,400.00 | Matched | $0.00 | Full amount received; status → “Paid”. |
| STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia – $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 – Maria Garcia – $5,350.00 | Matched | **‑$50.00** | Wire‑transfer fee deducted; to be recorded as Bank‑Fee Expense. |
| STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship – $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 – TechCorp – $12,000.00 | Matched | $0.00 | Scholarship revenue confirmed; status → “Paid”. |
| STU‑1125 – Robert Chen – $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 – R. Chen – $5,400.00 | Matched | $0.00 | Full amount received; status → “Paid”. |
| STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) – $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 – UNKNOWN – $2,100.00 | Matched | $0.00 | Amount aligns; payer identifier omitted in deposit record. |

### 4.1 Matched Entries  
All five ledger items have corresponding cash receipts; no tuition or scholarship items are missing.

### 4.2 Discrepancy – Maria Garcia  
* **Variance:** $‑50.00  
* **Root Cause:** Bank‑deducted wire‑transfer fee.  
* **Recommended Journal Entry:**  

| Account | Debit | Credit |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Bank‑Fees Expense | $50.00 | |
| Cash/Bank | | $50.00 |

### 4.3 “UNKNOWN” Deposit – Sarah Jenkins  
The $2,100 deposit matches the lab‑fee invoice for Sarah Jenkins (STU‑5501). The payer field was left blank by the bank.  

* **Action Required:** Request detailed remitter information from the bank and update internal receipt documentation to reflect Sarah Jenkins as the payer.

### 4.4 Missing Entries  
No missing tuition, scholarship, or lab‑fee entries were identified. Pending status flags in the ledger should be cleared after posting the above adjustments.

---  

## 5. Financial Impact Assessment  

### 5.1 Mathematical Consistency  

* **Total Ledger Amount:** $30,400.00 (3 × $5,400 + $12,000 + $2,100)  
* **Total Cash Received:** $30,350.00  
* **Net Variance:** $‑50.00 – fully explained by the documented wire‑transfer fee.  

### 5.2 Budget Implications  

| Item | Impact on Net Revenue |
|------|-----------------------|
| Tuition & Scholarship Revenue (gross) | $30,400.00 |
| Bank‑Fee Expense (wire fee) | **‑$50.00** |
| **Net Tuition Revenue** | **$30,350.00** |

The $50 expense reduces net tuition revenue but does not affect scholarship allocations or lab‑fee revenue.

## 6. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

| Area | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Revenue Realization** | All tuition, scholarship, and lab‑fee amounts captured in cash. | Supports cash‑flow forecasts for the fiscal period. |
| **Cost Management** | Wire‑transfer fee isolated and quantified. | Enables precise expense budgeting and potential fee‑recovery initiatives. |
| **Control Environment** | “UNKNOWN” payer indicates a weakness in remittance identification at the bank interface. | Recommend strengthening payer‑verification controls to preserve audit trail integrity. |
| **Scholarship Administration** | TechCorp scholarship fully realized. | Confirms compliance with external funding agreements. |
| **Student Billing** | Pending status not updated post‑reconciliation. | Overstated receivables risk; immediate status correction required. |

---  

## 7. Recommendations  

1. **Record the $50 wire‑transfer fee** as a separate Bank‑Fees Expense in the current period’s financial statements.  
2. **Update ledger status** for all five entries to “Paid” after posting the necessary adjustments.  
3. **Obtain remitter details** from the bank for the “UNKNOWN” deposit and amend internal records to attribute the $2,100 receipt to Sarah Jenkins (STU‑5501).  
4. **Implement a payer‑verification protocol** (e.g., mandatory reference field on all electronic transfers) to eliminate future “UNKNOWN” entries.  
5. **Review and negotiate bank fee structures** to reduce wire‑transfer costs associated with student payments.  

---  

## 8. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that tuition, scholarship, and lab‑fee receivables are mathematically consistent with cash receipts for the period under review. The sole variance—a $50 wire‑transfer fee—has been identified, quantified, and recommended for proper expense recognition. No tuition revenue is missing; however, the unidentified payer for the lab‑fee deposit reveals a control deficiency that should be remedied to maintain a complete audit trail. Adoption of the recommendations will enhance financial accuracy, improve cost visibility, and reinforce alignment with the institution’s budgeting and revenue‑recognition objectives.
