### RECONCILIATION REPORT  
**Tuition‑Related Accruals vs. Bank Deposit Statement**  
**Period Covered:** 5 January 2026 – 12 January 2026  

**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer – Finance Department  
**Date of Issue:** 12 January 2026  
**Report No.:** FIN‑REC‑2026‑001‑A  
**Version:** 1.0

## I. Scope & Objectives  

1. **Verification** – Confirm that every tuition‑related accrual recorded in the internal tuition ledger (Source A) is reflected in the bank deposit statement (Source B).  
2. **Variance Identification** – Quantify and explain all discrepancies, with emphasis on:  
   - The $50.00 shortfall for **Maria Garcia**.  
   - The “UNKNOWN” deposit of $2,100.00 and its relationship to **STU‑5501 (Sarah Jenkins – Lab Fee)**.  
3. **Missing‑Entry Flagging** – Detect any accruals lacking a corresponding cash receipt or any cash receipts lacking an accrual.  
4. **Impact Assessment** – Evaluate mathematical consistency, budgetary effect, and alignment with the institution’s revenue model.

## II. Data Sources & Matching Criteria  

| **Source A – Accrual Ledger** | **Source B – Bank Deposit** | **Matching Logic** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| ID STU‑8821 – James Wilson – $5,400.00 | Ref DEP‑001 – J. Wilson – $5,400.00 | Exact amount & payer name |
| ID STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia – $5,400.00 | Ref DEP‑002 – Maria Garcia – $5,350.00 | Amount differs by $50; bank note indicates “Wire Fee Deducted” |
| ID STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship – $12,000.00 | Ref DEP‑003 – TechCorp – $12,000.00 | Exact amount & corporate payer |
| ID STU‑1125 – Robert Chen – $5,400.00 | Ref DEP‑004 – R. Chen – $5,400.00 | Exact amount & payer name |
| ID STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) – $2,100.00 | Ref DEP‑005 – UNKNOWN – $2,100.00 | Amount matches; payer name absent |

*All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars.*

## III. Key Findings  

### A. Mathematical Consistency  

| Metric | Amount (USD) |
|--------|--------------|
| Total Accrued Tuition (Source A) | $30,400.00 |
| Total Deposited Cash (Source B) | $30,350.00 |
| Net Variance | **‑$50.00** (‑0.16 % of total) |

The net variance is fully accounted for by the wire‑fee deduction on Maria Garcia’s payment.

### B. Discrepancy – Maria Garcia  

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Accrual Amount (Source A) | $5,400.00 |
| Deposited Amount (Source B) | $5,350.00 |
| Variance | $50.00 |
| Root Cause | Bank statement note: “Wire Fee Deducted.” |
| Audit Implication | The $50.00 must be recorded as a **bank‑service expense** (or a reduction of tuition revenue) in the period of receipt to achieve cash‑to‑accrual reconciliation. |

### C. “UNKNOWN” Deposit – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee)  

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Accrual Entry (Source A) | STU‑5501 – Lab Fee – $2,100.00 (pending) |
| Deposit Entry (Source B) | REF‑005 – UNKNOWN – $2,100.00 |
| Interpretation | Amount matches exactly; payer identification omitted on the bank’s remittance advice. Possible explanations: <br>1. Student‑initiated payment where the payer field was left blank; <br>2. Third‑party payment (e.g., parent, scholarship) recorded without a reference. |
| Required Action | Obtain supporting documentation (e‑receipt, wire confirmation, or payer authorization) to confirm the source of funds and update the ledger with the correct payer name (Sarah Jenkins or appropriate third party). |

### D. Missing Entries  

- **Result:** All five accrual records have corresponding deposit entries. No unrecorded tuition or fee receipts were identified.  

### E. Budgetary Impact  

- **Revenue Forecast vs. Cash Realization:** The $50.00 wire fee represents a negligible deviation (<0.2 %) but must be reflected in cash‑flow projections and expense reporting.  
- **Lab‑Fee Allocation:** Confirmation of the “UNKNOWN” deposit is required to ensure the $2,100.00 lab‑fee revenue is captured in the appropriate departmental budget line.  

### F. Strategic Alignment  

| Revenue Component | Amount (USD) | Alignment Commentary |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Core Tuition (3 students × $5,400) | $16,200.00 | Consistent with enrollment targets for the period. |
| Corporate Scholarship (TechCorp) | $12,000.00 | Aligns with partnership agreement; recorded as tuition offset. |
| Ancillary Revenue – Lab Fee | $2,100.00 | Supports departmental operating funds; proper identification of payer enhances cost‑recovery analysis. |

## IV. Recommendations  

1. **Record Bank‑Fee Expense** – Debit **Bank‑Service Expense** $50.00; credit **Cash** $50.00 to reconcile the Maria Garcia variance.  
2. **Payer Verification for “UNKNOWN” Deposit** – Secure the original payment confirmation for REF‑005, assign the receipt to **Sarah Jenkins** (or the appropriate third‑party payer), and amend the student ledger accordingly.  
3. **Remittance‑Advice Enhancement** – Institute a mandatory requirement that all wire transfers include the full student identifier (e.g., student ID and name) in the payer field. Update bank instruction sheets and communicate the requirement to all payers.  
4. **Documentation of Fee Deduction** – Attach the bank statement note (“Wire Fee Deducted”) to the tuition‑revenue reconciliation work‑paper as supporting evidence for the $50.00 expense entry.  
5. **Periodic Reconciliation Cycle** – Conduct monthly tuition‑to‑cash reconciliations, incorporating a variance analysis for bank‑service fees and unidentified deposits, to maintain alignment with the budgeting cycle and internal control standards.

## V. Conclusion  

The reconciliation for the period 5 January 2026 – 12 January 2026 demonstrates overall mathematical integrity. The sole variance of $50.00 is a documented wire‑fee, and the “UNKNOWN” deposit aligns with the pending lab‑fee accrual pending payer verification. Implementation of the recommendations will close the minor gaps, reinforce internal controls, and sustain strategic revenue alignment.
