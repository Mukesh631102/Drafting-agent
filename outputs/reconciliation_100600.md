# Tuition Ledger – Bank Deposit Reconciliation  
**Period Covered:** 5 January 2026 – 10 January 2026 (Deposits posted 12 January 2026)  

Prepared by: Office of the Chief Financial Officer

## I. Executive Summary  

The reconciliation of the internal tuition ledger (accrual basis) to the bank deposit statement (cash basis) for the period 5‑10 January 2026 is mathematically complete. All five tuition/fee commitments recorded in the ledger have corresponding cash deposits. A single cash‑receipt variance of **$50.00** is attributable to a wire‑transfer fee deducted from Maria Garcia’s payment. The deposit recorded as “UNKNOWN” for $2,100.00 corresponds to the lab‑fee entry for Sarah Jenkins (STU‑5501) but lacks proper payer identification. No tuition‑fee entries are missing; however, control weaknesses are noted in payer documentation and fee‑expense recording.

## II. Reconciliation Scope & Data Sources  

| Source | Description | Period Covered |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **A – Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual)** | Student‑level tuition and fee commitments (status = Pending) | 5 Jan – 10 Jan 2026 |
| **B – Bank Deposit Statement (Cash)** | Actual cash receipts posted to the bank | 12 Jan 2026 |

The reconciliation exercise matches each ledger entry (Source A) to its corresponding bank deposit (Source B).

## III. Matching Matrix  

| Ledger ID (A) | Student / Entity | Fee (A) | Deposit Ref (B) | Payer (B) | Amount (B) | Match Status | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|--------|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| STU‑8821 | James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | ✅ Match | – |
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | ⚠️ Discrepancy | $50.00 wire‑fee deducted |
| STU‑4410 | TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | TechCorp | $12,000.00 | ✅ Match | – |
| STU‑1125 | Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | R. Chen | $5,400.00 | ✅ Match | – |
| STU‑5501 | Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | UNKNOWN | $2,100.00 | ✅ Match (identification issue) | Payer not recorded |

## IV. Discrepancy Analysis  

### 1. Maria Garcia – $50.00 Wire‑Transfer Fee  
- **Root Cause:** The bank deducted a $50.00 fee from the incoming wire.  
- **Accounting Impact:**  
  - Tuition revenue remains $5,400.00 (accrual).  
  - Net cash receipt is $5,350.00; the $50.00 variance must be recorded in the *Bank‑Fee Expense* account.  
- **Control Observation:** The ledger does not capture bank‑fee events; the reconciliation process must flag such deductions.

### 2. STU‑5501 – “UNKNOWN” Deposit  
- **Root Cause:** Deposit reference lacks payer identification; likely a cash or third‑party payment for the lab fee.  
- **Accounting Impact:** Revenue recognition of $2,100.00 is unchanged. Absence of payer information compromises the audit trail and may affect downstream reporting (scholarship allocation, donor acknowledgment).  
- **Control Observation:** Missing payer name violates the institution’s cash‑receipt documentation policy and represents a material control deficiency.

---

## V. Missing Entries  

- **Result:** All five tuition/fee commitments in Source A have corresponding cash deposits in Source B.  
- **Exception:** No unmatched deposits or unrecorded tuition fees were identified.  

---

## VI. Mathematical Consistency Review  

| Category | Total Accrued (A) | Total Deposited (B) | Net Difference |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Tuition & Fees | $30,300.00 | $30,250.00 | **‑$50.00** |
| Explanation | – | – | Wire‑fee on Maria Garcia’s payment |

The $50.00 variance is fully explained by the documented bank fee; no arithmetic errors are present.

---

## VII. Budget Impact Assessment  

- **Revenue Recognition:** Full tuition revenue of $30,300.00 is recognized per accrual accounting; the cash shortfall does not affect the budgeted tuition income.  
- **Expense Implication:** The $50.00 bank fee should be budgeted under *Bank Service Charges* (or an equivalent expense line).  
- **Cash‑Flow Projection:** Net cash available for the period is $30,250.00. The $50.00 shortfall is immaterial but must be reflected in cash‑flow statements.  

---

## VIII. Strategic Alignment Considerations  

1. **Revenue Integrity:** Accurate matching of tuition commitments to cash receipts safeguards financial statements and supports accreditation requirements.  
2. **Control Environment:** The unidentified “UNKNOWN” deposit highlights a weakness in cash‑receipt documentation that could expose the institution to misallocation risk or audit findings.  
3. **Cost Management:** Recording bank fees ensures the true cost of tuition collection is captured, informing decisions on preferred payment methods (e.g., encouraging ACH over wire).  
4. **Stakeholder Transparency:** Proper payer identification is essential for donor/parent communication, scholarship reporting, and compliance with external grant conditions.

## IX. Recommendations  

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Implement a Bank‑Fee Capture Procedure** – automatically flag deposits where the received amount differs from the invoiced amount and post the variance to a “Bank‑Fee Expense” account. | Guarantees all fee deductions are recorded and reflected in cash‑flow analysis. |
| 2 | **Enhance Deposit Documentation** – require the payer’s full name (or entity) on all deposit slips; for cash or third‑party payments, obtain a signed receipt. | Eliminates “UNKNOWN” entries, strengthens audit trail, and supports donor/parent reporting. |
| 3 | **Reconcile Daily** – perform a daily ledger‑to‑bank reconciliation to detect discrepancies promptly. | Reduces risk of material misstatement and improves cash‑management responsiveness. |
| 4 | **Update Tuition Ledger Status** – change status from “Pending” to “Collected” once the deposit is verified, and annotate any fee deductions. | Improves data integrity and provides real‑time visibility of receivable collection. |
| 5 | **Periodic Review of Payment Method Costs** – analyze the cost impact of wire transfers versus ACH/e‑check to guide policy on preferred payment channels. | Aligns collection strategy with cost‑efficiency objectives. |

---

## X. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that all tuition and fee obligations recorded in the internal ledger have been received in cash, with a single, explainable $50.00 bank‑fee variance. No missing tuition entries were identified; however, the lack of payer identification for the lab‑fee deposit represents a control deficiency. Adoption of the recommended procedural enhancements will improve mathematical consistency, ensure accurate budgeting of collection costs, and reinforce strategic financial stewardship for the institution.
