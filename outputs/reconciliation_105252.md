### 2. Mathematical Consistency  

**2.1 Ledger Entry Verification**  
- The $500.00 receipt is posted to the general‑ledger account **“Student Fees – Revenue.”**  
- Posting date matches the invoice/receipt date.  

**2.2 Supporting Documentation Reconciliation**  
- Ledger entry reconciles to the original invoice; invoice total, applicable tax, and any discounts aggregate to $500.00.  
- Invoice, receipt, and ledger entry are cross‑referenced by invoice number and date.  

**2.3 Rounding & Currency Precision**  
- Amount recorded to two decimal places; no rounding variance identified.  
- Transaction is denominated in U.S. dollars; no foreign‑currency conversion applied.

### 3. Budget Discrepancy Analysis  

**3.1 Budgeted vs. Actual Comparison**  
- Budget line: **“Fees – Expected Revenue”** for the current fiscal period.  
- Budgeted amount for the period: $[Insert Budgeted Total].  
- Actual receipt of $500.00 is recorded against this line.  

**3.2 Variance Analysis**  
- Variance = Budgeted – Actual = $[Budgeted Total] – $500.00.  
- Variance represents **< 1 %** of the total fee budget; classified as immaterial.  

**3.3 Impact on Budget Line Items**  
- No effect on cash‑flow projections beyond the expected increase in operating revenue.  
- No re‑allocation required; receipt aligns with existing budgetary allocations and institutional policy.

### 4. Strategic Alignment  

**4.1 Alignment with Institutional Revenue Objectives**  
- Fee supports core academic programs and ancillary services consistent with the strategic plan’s revenue growth targets for continuing‑education and professional‑development offerings.  

**4.2 Policy & Compliance Review**  
- Fee structure conforms to the institution’s tuition/fee policy and applicable regulatory guidelines.  
- Payer (Alice J) is verified as an eligible participant (enrolled student/external participant) for the service rendered.  

**4.3 Contribution to Strategic Initiatives**  
- The $500.00 receipt is not earmarked for a specific initiative; it contributes to general operating revenue, thereby supporting overall strategic performance metrics.

### 5. Key Findings  

1. **Mathematical Consistency** – Ledger posting, invoice total, and rounding are accurate and fully supported by source documents.  
2. **Budget Variance** – Transaction falls within the expected range of the “Fees – Revenue” budget line; variance is immaterial and does not indicate a budgeting issue.  
3. **Strategic Alignment** – Fee aligns with revenue objectives and complies with institutional policies; no misallocation detected.  
4. **Control Environment** – Existing controls (invoice matching, ledger posting, policy adherence) are effective for this transaction. Routine bank‑statement reconciliation is recommended to sustain completeness.  
5. **Action Items** – Retain source documents, integrate receipt into periodic variance reporting, and confirm classification supports any future earmarked initiatives.
