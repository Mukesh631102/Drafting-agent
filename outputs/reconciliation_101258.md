### 1. Reconciliation Scope & Objectives  

- Verify completeness and accuracy of tuition revenue recorded in the internal accrual ledger (Source A) against cash receipts reflected in the bank deposit statement (Source B).  
- Quantify and document all variances, missing entries, and mis‑attributions.  
- Assess impact on revenue recognition, expense classification, and budgetary forecasts.

### 2. Source Data Overview  

| Source | Period | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **A – Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual)** | Jan 5 – Jan 10 2026 | Five tuition‑related entries, all with “Pending” status. |
| **B – Bank Deposit Statement (Cash)** | Jan 12 2026 | Five deposit records, including one with a wire‑fee deduction and one with an unidentified payer. |

*Full source listings are provided in **Appendix A**.*

### 3. Matching Methodology  

1. **Identifier Mapping** – Student/Scholarship ID (Source A) linked to Deposit Reference (Source B).  
2. **Amount Verification** – Ledger fee compared to deposited amount; any deviation recorded.  
3. **Status Confirmation** – “Pending” entries updated to “Cleared” where a matching deposit is confirmed.

### 4. Discrepancy Analysis  

| Ledger ID | Student / Scholarship | Ledger Fee | Deposit Ref | Deposit Payer | Deposit Amount | Variance | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | **‑$50.00** | Bank‑deducted wire‑transfer fee. |
| STU‑5501 | Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | UNKNOWN | $2,100.00 | $0.00 | Payer field omitted; deposit corresponds to lab‑fee payment. |

All remaining entries reconcile on a dollar‑for‑dollar basis.  

---

### 5. Missing Entry Identification  

- Every ledger ID (STU‑8821, STU‑9902, STU‑4410, STU‑1125, STU‑5501) has a corresponding deposit record.  
- No cash‑only deposits lack a matching ledger entry.  

**Conclusion:** No missing entries identified.

### 6. Analytical Review  

#### 6.1 Mathematical Consistency  

- **Total Gross Tuition (Ledger):** $30,300.00  
- **Total Cash Received (Bank):** $30,250.00  
- **Net Variance:** $‑50.00 – fully explained by the wire‑fee on Maria Garcia’s payment.  

#### 6.2 Budget Impact Assessment  

| Impact Category | Accounting Treatment | Effect on Financial Statements |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Tuition Revenue | Recognize gross amount $30,300.00 | Increases tuition‑revenue line. |
| Bank‑Service Expense | Record $50.00 fee (Expense – Bank Fees) | Reduces net cash inflow to $30,250.00. |
| Scholarship Allocation | Track $12,000.00 scholarship as restricted revenue offset by scholarship expense. | Ensures compliance with scholarship‑funding agreements. |

#### 6.3 Strategic Alignment Considerations  

- Accurate tuition capture underpins instructional‑program budgeting and cash‑flow forecasting.  
- Prompt identification of bank fees enhances expense predictability and supports treasury‑management controls.  
- Correct attribution of lab‑fee payments improves cost allocation for laboratory resources, aligning with the institution’s STEM‑facility strategy.

### 7. Findings Summary  

- **Exact Matches (Amount & Identifier):** STU‑8821, STU‑1125, STU‑4410.  
- **Identified Discrepancy:** $50.00 wire‑fee on Maria Garcia’s payment; to be recorded as a bank‑service expense.  
- **Unknown Deposit Attribution:** DEP‑005 correctly matches Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee); payer field to be corrected.  
- **Missing Entries:** None.  
- **Overall Variance:** $50.00, fully explained.

### 8. Recommendations & Action Items  

| # | Recommendation | Action Owner | Target Completion |
|---|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Update ledger status from “Pending” to “Cleared” for all matched entries. | Treasury Operations | 01‑Feb‑2026 |
| 2 | Record $50.00 wire‑fee as a separate Bank‑Fee expense; adjust net tuition revenue accordingly. | Accounting – General Ledger | 01‑Feb‑2026 |
| 3 | Amend Deposit DEP‑005 payer information to “S. Jenkins” and link to STU‑5501. | Cash Management Team | 01‑Feb‑2026 |
| 4 | Implement an automated reconciliation control that flags bank‑deducted fees at deposit posting. | Finance Systems & Controls | 31‑Mar‑2026 |
| 5 | Conduct quarterly reviews of pending tuition entries to ensure timely clearance and accurate financial reporting. | CFO Office – Reporting | Ongoing (first review 30‑Jun‑2026) |

---

### 9. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that tuition revenue recorded on an accrual basis is complete and accurate, with a single, fully explained variance attributable to a bank‑service fee. Implementation of the recommended controls will mitigate recurrence of similar variances and reinforce the integrity of tuition‑revenue reporting.
