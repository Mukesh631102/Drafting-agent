### I. Executive Summary  

The reconciliation of internal tuition‑and‑grant receivables (Source A) to bank‑deposit records (Source B) for January 2026 reveals a net cash shortfall of **$250.00**. The shortfall is fully explained by a $50.00 bank‑transfer fee deducted from a tuition payment and a $200.00 partial receipt of a corporate grant. All other tuition payments are fully accounted for, though one deposit lacks proper payer identification, presenting a compliance risk.

### III. Reconciliation Methodology  

**A. Matching Criteria**  
1. Name similarity (full legal name vs. bank remittance name).  
2. Amount equivalence (within $0.01).  
3. Transaction‑date proximity (same calendar month).  

**B. Matched Items**  
- James P. Wilson – $12,400.00 (Deposit DEP‑991).  
- Robert Chen – $1,500.00 (Deposit DEP‑993).  
- Sarah Jenkins – $12,400.00 (Deposit DEP‑994) – pending payer verification.  

**C. Anomalous / Unmatched Items**  
1. **Maria Garcia‑Lopez** – Deposit $8,150.00 (fee‑adjusted).  
2. **Global Tech Corp** – Deposit $44,800.00 (partial grant).  
3. **Anonymous Deposit** – $12,400.00 lacks identifiable payer; amount matches Sarah Jenkins’ tuition.

### IV. Mathematical Consistency Analysis  

| **Metric**                     | **Amount (USD)** |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Total Amount Due (Source A)    | $79,500.00 |
| Total Deposits Received (Source B) | $79,250.00 |
| **Net Variance**               | **$250.00 shortfall** |

**Variance Breakdown**  

| Item                              | Impact (USD) |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Transfer fee on Maria Garcia‑Lopez | –$50.00 |
| Grant shortfall – Global Tech Corp | –$200.00 |
| Anonymous deposit – no monetary shortfall (amount matches tuition) | $0.00 |
| **Total Explained Variance**      | **–$250.00** |

The variance is fully accounted for by the two identified adjustments.

### V. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

1. **Tuition Revenue** – The $50.00 transfer fee reduces net cash inflow; it must be recorded as a bank‑service expense and deducted from tuition receivable.  
2. **Grant Funding** – The $200.00 shortfall on the Global Tech Corp grant may affect program‑specific budgets. Clarification is required to determine whether the amount represents a processing fee, a partial disbursement, or a reporting error.  
3. **Unidentified Deposit** – The anonymous $12,400.00 deposit aligns with Sarah Jenkins’ tuition amount but lacks payer identification, exposing the institution to audit‑trail and compliance risk.  

---

### VI. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

| Area | Observation | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Revenue Recognition** | Tuition and grant receivables must be recorded net of external fees. | Ensures financial statements reflect true cash inflow. |
| **Cash‑Flow Management** | Aggregate shortfall of $250.00, while modest, should be monitored for cumulative impact on operating liquidity. | Supports prudent liquidity planning. |
| **Control Environment** | Inconsistent naming conventions and unidentified deposits indicate weaknesses in payer‑verification processes. | Necessitates enhancement of data‑capture standards and internal controls. |

---

### VII. Recommendations  

1. **Fee Accounting** – Record the $50.00 transfer fee as a “Bank‑Service Expense” (GL 6100) and adjust the tuition receivable for Maria Garcia‑Lopez accordingly.  
2. **Grant Follow‑Up** – Contact Global Tech Corp to confirm the nature of the $200.00 discrepancy; obtain written confirmation of any fee or partial disbursement and adjust the grant receivable (GL 4200) upon resolution.  
3. **Payer Identification** – Investigate the anonymous $12,400.00 deposit; procure supporting documentation (e.g., remittance advice, student acknowledgment) to confirm it pertains to Sarah Jenkins. Update the ledger and bank‑reconciliation entries once verified.  
4. **Data‑Quality Controls** – Implement a standardized naming schema (full legal name, no abbreviations) across the internal student ledger and bank remittance files. Deploy automated validation rules to flag mismatches at the point of entry.  
5. **Reconciliation Frequency** – Conduct weekly reconciliations of tuition and grant receivables to detect and resolve variances promptly. Document all exceptions in a reconciliation log (GL 9999).  
6. **Documentation & Audit Trail** – Retain all remittance advices, fee notices, and correspondence with external payers for a minimum of seven years in accordance with institutional policy and regulatory requirements.  

---

### VIII. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that the $250.00 net shortfall is fully explained by a documented transfer fee and a partial grant receipt. All other tuition payments are accounted for, subject to verification of the anonymous deposit. Implementation of the recommended controls will mitigate future revenue leakage, strengthen compliance, and enhance the reliability of cash‑flow reporting.
