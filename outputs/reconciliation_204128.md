### 1. Objective & Scope  

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Verify that all tuition‑related accruals (Source A) are reflected in cash receipts (Source B) and isolate any variances. |
| **Scope** | Student tuition, corporate scholarship, and ancillary laboratory fee for the accrual period 5‑10 Jan 2026 compared with the bank‑deposit statement dated 12 Jan 2026. |

### 2. Matching Summary  

| Source A – ID / Name | Accrued Fee | Source B – Ref / Payer | Cash Received | Match Status |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| STU‑8821 – James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 – J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | Matched – Full |
| STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 – Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | Partial – $50 short |
| STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 – TechCorp | $12,000.00 | Matched – Full |
| STU‑1125 – Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 – R. Chen | $5,400.00 | Matched – Full |
| STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 – UNKNOWN | $2,100.00 | Matched – Payer unidentified |

---

### 3. Discrepancy Analysis  

| Discrepancy | Root Cause | Accounting Treatment |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Maria Garcia – $50.00 shortfall** | Bank‑wire transfer fee deducted (see DEP‑002 note). | Record $50.00 as **Bank Service Charge** expense; tuition revenue remains $5,400.00. |
| **STU‑5501 – “UNKNOWN” deposit** | Payer identifier omitted on bank file; amount aligns exactly with the pending lab‑fee accrual. | Obtain supporting invoice/receipt to confirm Sarah Jenkins as payer; update bank reference accordingly. |

---

### 4. Missing Entries  

- **Cash Receipts:** No missing deposits; each accrual in Source A has a corresponding entry in Source B.  
- **Outstanding Items to Record:**  
  1. Bank‑fee expense of $50.00 (Maria Garcia).  
  2. Confirmation of payer for DEP‑005 (lab fee).  

---

### 5. Quantitative Consistency  

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total Accrued Tuition (Source A) | **$30,300.00** |
| Total Cash Received (Source B) | **$30,250.00** |
| Net Difference (Cash – Accrual) | **‑$50.00** |
| Adjusted Variance after Bank‑Fee Expense | **$0.00** |

*The $50.00 variance is fully explained by the wire‑transfer fee.*

---

### 6. Budget Impact Assessment  

| Impact Area | Assessment |
|-------------|------------|
| **Revenue Recognition** | All tuition, scholarship, and lab‑fee amounts are realized. The $12,000 scholarship is recorded as tuition revenue offset by a scholarship expense per policy. |
| **Expense Recognition** | $50.00 bank‑fee is an unbudgeted operating expense; recommend inclusion in the “Bank Service Charges” line‑item. |
| **Variance** | No material variance to the approved tuition budget after adjusting for the bank fee. |
| **Overall Budget Position** | Within tolerance; variance immaterial. |

---

### 7. Strategic Alignment Review  

| Category | Alignment with Institutional Strategy |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Core Tuition (4 × $5,400) | Direct support of primary revenue stream – fully realized. |
| Corporate Scholarship (TechCorp) | Enhances partnership and brand positioning – fully realized. |
| Lab Fee (Sarah Jenkins) | Generates ancillary revenue for laboratory resources – realized pending payer confirmation. |
| Bank‑Fee Management | Opportunity to reduce future wire‑transfer costs through policy revision (e.g., ACH, electronic invoicing). |

---

### 8. Key Findings  

1. **Complete matching** of all accruals to cash receipts; only a $50.00 bank‑fee variance identified.  
2. **Maria Garcia shortfall** is attributable to a wire‑transfer fee; requires expense recording.  
3. **Lab‑fee deposit** matches the “UNKNOWN” bank entry; payer verification is pending but amount is correct.  
4. **No missing tuition or scholarship entries**; reconciliation is mathematically sound after adjusting for the bank fee.  
5. **Budget variance** is immaterial; the $50.00 fee should be reflected in operating expenses.  
6. **Strategic objectives** (revenue generation, corporate partnership, ancillary funding) are fully supported by the reconciled transactions.  

---

### 9. Recommendations  

1. **Record a $50.00 bank‑fee expense** in the period’s operating expense ledger (Bank Service Charges).  
2. **Obtain supporting documentation** (invoice/receipt) for DEP‑005 to confirm Sarah Jenkins as the payer and amend the bank reference.  
3. **Update internal ledger status** from “Pending” to “Cleared” for all matched entries.  
4. **Review payment‑method policies** to mitigate future wire‑fee exposures; prioritize ACH or fee‑free electronic payments.  
5. **Document the reconciliation** in the audit trail with cross‑referencing of Source A and Source B entries, including the noted variance and corrective actions.
