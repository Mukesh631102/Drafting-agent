**January 2026**

# I. Executive Summary  

The purpose of this report is to document the reconciliation of internal tuition and grant receivable records (Source A) with the corresponding bank deposits (Source B) for the month of January 2026. The reconciliation identified a net shortfall of **$250.00**, which is fully explained by two isolated variances: a $50 external transfer fee and a $200 grant‑receipt shortfall. The findings highlight minor control weaknesses in payer identification and fee capture that, if unaddressed, could affect cash‑flow forecasting, grant compliance, and the integrity of revenue reporting.  

# II. Objectives & Scope  

1. **Mathematical Consistency** – Verify that the aggregate and item‑level amounts recorded in the internal student ledger are consistent with cleared bank deposits.  
2. **Budgetary Variance Identification** – Detect any discrepancies that may impact cash‑flow projections, expense recognition, or grant‑reporting obligations.  
3. **Strategic Control Assessment** – Evaluate the alignment of reconciliation outcomes with the institution’s financial control framework and recommend enhancements where gaps are identified.  

Scope is limited to tuition, lab‑fee, and grant receivables recorded for January 2026. All supporting documentation (invoices, bank confirmations, grant award letters) has been reviewed and retained as part of the audit trail.  

# III. Data Sources  

| Source | Description | Period Covered | Primary Fields |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **A – Internal Student Ledger** | School‑recorded tuition, lab fees, and grant receivables | January 2026 | Student ID, Student Name, Amount Due, Category, Status |
| **B – Bank Statement** | Cleared deposits received from payers | January 2026 | Transaction Date, Deposit ID, Payer Name, Amount (net of external fees) |

# IV. Reconciliation Methodology  

1. **Matching Criteria** – Records were matched on the basis of (i) amount, (ii) payer name (or logical alias), and (iii) transaction date.  
2. **Procedural Steps**  
   - Imported Source A and Source B into a dedicated reconciliation worksheet.  
   - Applied exact‑match logic; items failing to match were flagged for investigation.  
   - Investigated flagged items for (a) external fee deductions, (b) naming discrepancies, and (c) timing differences.  
3. **Documentation & Audit Trail** – All adjustments are supported by:  
   - Transfer‑fee invoice (Maria Garcia‑Lopez)  
   - Grant award agreement and bank remittance advice (Global Tech Corp)  
   - Bank confirmation of the “ANONYMOUS” deposit (Sarah Jenkins)  

# V. Findings  

## 5.1 Mathematical Consistency  

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total Amount Due (Source A) | **$79,500.00** |
| Total Deposits Received (Source B) | **$79,250.00** |
| Net Shortfall | **$250.00** |

### Item‑Level Comparison  

| Student / Entity | Amount Due (A) | Deposit Received (B) | Variance | Note |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|------|
| James P. Wilson | $12,400.00 | $12,400.00 | $0.00 | Fully reconciled |
| Maria Garcia‑Lopez | $8,200.00 | $8,150.00 | **‑$50.00** | $50 transfer fee deducted by intermediary |
| Robert Chen | $1,500.00 | $1,500.00 | $0.00 | Fully reconciled |
| Sarah Jenkins | $12,400.00 | $12,400.00 | $0.00 | Deposit recorded as “ANONYMOUS” – payer identification mismatch |
| Global Tech Corp (Grant) | $45,000.00 | $44,800.00 | **‑$200.00** | Deposit recorded as “GTC SPON”; shortfall not reflected in ledger |

## 5.2 Potential Budget Discrepancies  

- **Unrecorded Transfer Fee** – $50 fee on Maria Garcia‑Lopez’s tuition is absent from the internal ledger, resulting in an overstated receivable and understated expense.  
- **Grant Shortfall** – $200 variance between expected grant amount and actual deposit; the ledger does not capture the reduction, potentially affecting compliance reporting to the funding agency.  
- **Anonymous Deposit** – $12,400 deposit matching Sarah Jenkins’ tuition lacks proper payer attribution, creating a risk of misallocation and weakening the audit trail.  

## 5.3 Strategic Alignment  

- **Cash‑Flow Management** – The $250 aggregate shortfall, while modest, signals gaps in fee capture and grant‑receipt tracking that could compound over longer periods.  
- **Compliance & Grant Administration** – Inaccurate grant recording may jeopardize reporting obligations and future funding eligibility.  
- **Control Environment** – Naming inconsistencies (“ANONYMOUS”, “GTC SPON”) indicate a need for stricter payer‑verification protocols to safeguard revenue integrity.  

# VI. Recommendations  

1. **Post External Fee as Expense** – Record the $50 transfer fee in a “Bank‑Fee” expense sub‑ledger and reduce the corresponding tuition receivable.  
2. **Validate Anonymous Deposit** – Conduct a source‑verification inquiry; re‑code the $12,400 deposit to Sarah Jenkins’ account or flag for further investigation pending payer confirmation.  
3. **Reconcile Grant Receipt** – Obtain the grant award agreement and bank remittance advice; adjust the grant receivable by $200 to reflect the actual amount received.  
4. **Enhance Reconciliation Controls**  
   - Enforce mandatory payer‑name matching (e.g., require student ID on bank remittance).  
   - Implement an automated “Fee‑Deduction” sub‑ledger to capture all external charges at the point of receipt.  
   - Schedule monthly variance analysis with documented exception handling to detect and resolve discrepancies promptly.  
5. **Document All Adjustments** – Ensure each reconciliation entry is supported by appropriate evidence (fee invoices, grant award letters, bank confirmations) and retained in accordance with the institution’s records‑retention policy.  

# VII. Conclusion  

The reconciliation of January 2026 tuition and grant receivables confirms that the $250 net shortfall is fully explained by two identifiable variances: a $50 external transfer fee and a $200 grant‑receipt shortfall. Addressing the identified control weaknesses—specifically payer identification, fee capture, and grant‑receipt documentation—will improve financial accuracy, reinforce compliance with grant reporting requirements, and strengthen the institution’s overall fiscal stewardship.
