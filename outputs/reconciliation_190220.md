**CONFIDENTIAL – RECONCILIATION DOCUMENT**  
**Date:** January 14 2026  
**Prepared for:** XYZ Educational Institution  
**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer Office  
**Document ID:** RECON‑2026‑01‑14  
**Version:** 1.0

### 1. Executive Summary  

- **Purpose:** To reconcile the source term sheet with the draft lease agreement and assess the financial and strategic implications for the institution.  
- **Scope:** Evaluation of rent, lease term, parking, maintenance & repairs, and utilities; analysis of mathematical consistency, potential budget discrepancies, and strategic alignment with institutional objectives.

### 2. Source Document vs. Draft Comparison  

| Item | Source Term Sheet | Draft Lease (Agent’s First Pass) | Discrepancy |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **2.1 Rent & Lease Term** | $5,000 / month; 3‑year term (36 months) | $5,000 / month; 36‑month term (Jan 1 – Dec 31, Year 3) | None – terms identical |
| **2.2 Parking** | 2 reserved spots, **no cost** to tenant | No parking provision referenced | Omission of two complimentary spots |
| **2.3 Maintenance & Repairs** | Tenant – internal repairs; Landlord – roof (structural) | Landlord – “all structural repairs”; Tenant – no internal‑repair clause | Internal‑repair responsibility not allocated |
| **2.4 Utilities** | No utility allocation stated | Tenant – “all utility costs” | New tenant‑borne expense introduced |

---

### 3. Mathematical Consistency  

- **3.1 Rent Calculation** – $5,000 × 36 months = **$180,000** total rent obligation (identical in both documents).  
- **3.2 Term Alignment** – Both documents specify a 36‑month lease; no term discrepancy.  
- **3.3 Missing Quantitative Elements** – Parking value, internal‑repair costs, and utility expenses are unquantified in the draft, creating potential variance from the source cost baseline.  

---

### 4. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Issue | Impact | Estimated Cost (3‑year term) |
|-------|--------|------------------------------|
| **4.1 Parking Benefit Omission** | Loss of two free spots may require market‑rate parking. | $150–$200 / spot / month → $3,600–$4,800 / year → **$10,800–$14,400** |
| **4.2 Internal‑Repair Responsibility Gap** | Undefined allocation may shift cost to landlord or remain unbudgeted. | Indeterminate; material to operating budget |
| **4.3 Utility Cost Introduction** | Tenant now bears all utility expenses without cap or estimate. | Indeterminate; material to operating budget |
| **4.4 Aggregate Impact** | Baseline rent $180,000 + potential parking up to $14,400 + undefined repair & utility costs. | **≥ $20,000** increase in total cost of occupancy (minimum estimate) |

### 5. Strategic Alignment for an Educational Institution  

- **5.1 Lease Term Suitability** – A 3‑year horizon may be short for multi‑year academic planning; renewal or longer initial term advisable.  
- **5.2 Cost Predictability** – Omitted parking and undefined maintenance/utilities impair the institution’s ability to forecast total cost of occupancy (TCO) with confidence.  
- **5.3 Facility Requirements** – Reserved parking is critical for faculty, staff, and student access; omission could disrupt campus logistics.  
- **5.4 Risk Exposure** – Ambiguities in repair responsibilities increase operational risk (e.g., unexpected internal‑repair invoices).  
- **5.5 Alignment with Institutional Budget Policies** – Policies require explicit enumeration of all tenant‑borne expenses; the draft fails to meet this requirement, exposing the institution to compliance and financial‑planning risks.  

---

### 6. Recommendations  

1. **Parking Inclusion** – Amend the draft to expressly provide the two complimentary reserved parking spaces.  
2. **Internal‑Repair Clause** – Insert a clause assigning the tenant responsibility for internal (non‑structural) repairs, consistent with the source term sheet.  
3. **Utility Cost Allocation** – Clarify utility obligations: retain tenant responsibility with a reasonable cap or negotiate a shared‑cost model to ensure budgeting certainty.  
4. **Renewal/Extension Provision** – Add an option to extend the lease for an additional 2–3 years, or incorporate a renewal clause aligned with academic planning cycles.  
5. **Market‑Rate Benchmark** – Conduct a benchmark analysis of rent, parking, and utility rates for comparable educational facilities to confirm the $5,000 / month rent is competitive.  

---

### 7. Conclusion  

- Rent amount and lease term are mathematically consistent; total rent obligation equals **$180,000** over 36 months.  
- The draft lease omits the two free parking spaces, fails to allocate internal‑repair responsibility, and introduces an undefined utility expense, resulting in a potential minimum increase of **$20,000** to the institution’s total cost of occupancy.  
- Strategic misalignments identified include insufficient lease term length, lack of cost predictability, and inadequate provision for essential parking.  
- Adoption of the recommendations will align the lease with the source term sheet, satisfy institutional budgeting policies, and mitigate operational risk.  

Prepared in accordance with professional audit standards and the institution’s procurement and budgeting requirements.
