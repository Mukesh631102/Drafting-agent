## 5. Financial Analysis  

### 5.1 Mathematical Consistency  

- **Line‑Item Verification:**  
  - Venue: ₹20,000  
  - Materials: ₹15,000  
  - Guest Honorarium: ₹10,000  
  - Contingency: ₹5,000  
  - **Total:** ₹50,000 (accurately summed).  

- **Budgetary Fit:**  
  - Requested amount = 25 % of the total cultural‑activities allocation (₹200,000).  
  - Within the Board‑approved ceiling of 30 % per line‑item.  

- **Cash‑Flow Impact:**  
  - Available liquid reserves: ₹1.2 million.  
  - No adverse effect on cash‑flow projections.

### 5.2 Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Issue | Detail | Recommended Action |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **Duplicate Expense Risk** | “Materials” cost overlaps with previously approved “Stationery” budget. | Re‑classify or adjust to avoid double‑counting. |
| **Contingency Allocation** | ₹5,000 exceeds the standard 3 % contingency policy (₹1,500). | Reduce to policy limit or obtain Board approval for excess. |
| **Unallocated Overhead** | No provision for post‑event reporting costs (~₹2,000). | Allocate a modest reporting fund. |

### 5.3 Strategic Alignment  

- **Mission Congruence:** Direct support for the “Holistic Development” pillar and the Board’s target of ≥ 4 cultural events per academic year.  
- **Student Impact:** Anticipated participation of 150 students (≈0.33 % of total enrollment) exceeds the minimum engagement threshold of 0.25 %.  
- **Community Outreach:** Inclusion of external performers aligns with the KPI to increase local partnerships by 10 %.

## 6. Key Findings  

| Area | Finding | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Mathematical Consistency** | The ₹50,000 request is accurately calculated and conforms to the approved cultural‑activities budget ceiling. | Confirms financial viability; no arithmetic errors. |
| **Budget Discrepancies** | • Potential double‑counting of material costs.<br>• Contingency exceeds policy limit.<br>• Absence of post‑event reporting fund. | Risks over‑statement of expenses and non‑compliance with internal controls. |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Expenditure aligns with institutional goals (holistic development, student engagement, community outreach). | Provides programmatic justification; supports strategic objectives. |

## 7. Recommendations  

1. **Re‑classify material costs** to eliminate duplication with the stationery budget.  
2. **Adjust contingency** to the policy‑mandated 3 % (₹1,500) or secure explicit Board approval for the higher amount.  
3. **Allocate a post‑event reporting fund** of approximately ₹2,000 to ensure complete financial documentation.  
4. **Document justification** for any deviation from policy (e.g., increased contingency) and obtain formal sign‑off from the Finance Committee.  

Implementation of these actions will ensure full compliance with internal financial controls while preserving the strategic benefits of the cultural program.

## 8. Conclusion  

The proposed ₹50,000 cultural‑fees allocation is mathematically sound and strategically justified. Minor budgetary adjustments—re‑classification of material costs, contingency alignment, and inclusion of a reporting fund—are required to achieve complete compliance with the school’s financial policies. Upon adoption of the recommended actions, the allocation may be approved without reservation.
