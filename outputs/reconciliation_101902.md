### I. Objective & Scope  

1. Verify that all tuition‑related accruals recorded in **Source A (Internal Tuition Ledger)** are reflected in **Source B (Bank Deposit Statement)**.  
2. Identify and quantify any variances, missing entries, or classification issues.  
3. Assess the impact of identified variances on the institution’s budget and strategic financial objectives.

### III. Matching Summary  

| **Ledger ID** | **Accrued Fee (USD)** | **Deposit Ref.** | **Deposit Amount (USD)** | **Variance (USD)** | **Comment** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| STU‑8821 – James Wilson | 5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | 5,400.00 | 0.00 | Full match |
| STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia | 5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | 5,350.00 | **‑50.00** | Wire‑transfer fee deducted |
| STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship | 12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | 12,000.00 | 0.00 | Full match |
| STU‑1125 – Robert Chen | 5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | 5,400.00 | 0.00 | Full match |

**Aggregate Totals**  

- **Total Accrued Tuition (Source A):** $30,400.00  
- **Total Cash Deposited (Source B):** $30,350.00  
- **Net Variance:** **‑$50.00** (attributable to Maria Garcia’s wire‑fee deduction)  

---

### IV. Discrepancy Analysis  

1. **Maria Garcia – $50.00 Shortfall**  
   - **Root Cause:** Bank statement indicates a wire‑transfer fee of $50 was deducted from the deposit. The ledger does not contain a corresponding expense or receivable reduction.  
   - **Implication:** Accrued revenue ($5,400) exceeds cash received ($5,350). The $50 must be classified as a **Bank Transfer Expense** (or passed to the student per tuition policy) to avoid overstating net tuition revenue.  

2. **STU‑5501 – “UNKNOWN” Deposit**  
   - **Root Cause:** The deposit reference lacks a payer identifier. The amount ($2,100) matches the lab‑fee accrual for Sarah Jenkins, indicating a **record‑keeping lapse** rather than a missing cash receipt.  
   - **Implication:** Absence of payer detail weakens the audit trail, impairs compliance with anti‑money‑laundering (AML) controls, and hampers cost‑center allocation for laboratory resources.  

---

### V. Missing Entries  

All five accrual entries have corresponding cash deposits. No tuition or scholarship accruals are unaccounted for in the bank statement.  

---

### VI. Mathematical Consistency  

| **Component** | **Amount (USD)** |
|---|---|
| Total Accrued Tuition (Source A) | 30,400.00 |
| Total Deposited Cash (Source B) | 30,350.00 |
| **Net Difference** | **‑50.00** |
| Reconciliation Status | **Unadjusted variance of $50** (explained in Section IV) |

The variance is isolated to a single transaction; all other line items reconcile perfectly, confirming arithmetic integrity.  

---

### VII. Budget & Strategic Impact  

- **Revenue Recognition:** Accruals are correctly recorded; the $50 wire‑fee must be reflected as an expense to prevent overstating net tuition revenue in the Operating Budget.  
- **Scholarship & Corporate Funding:** TechCorp’s $12,000 scholarship is fully realized, supporting diversification of revenue streams.  
- **Lab‑Fee Collection:** Cash receipt is confirmed, but the lack of payer attribution may impede future student‑accountability reporting and laboratory cost allocation.  
- **Control Environment:** The “UNKNOWN” payer entry and unrecorded wire‑fee expense reveal gaps in cash‑receipt documentation and expense classification. Remediation aligns with best‑practice financial governance and the institution’s strategic emphasis on transparency and compliance.

### VIII. Recommendations  

| **Recommendation** | **Rationale** | **Priority** |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Record the $50 wire‑fee as a **Bank Transfer Expense** (or allocate to the student account per tuition policy). | Aligns cash receipt with accruals; prevents revenue overstatement. | High |
| 2. Amend the bank‑deposit log to capture **payer identification** for all deposits, especially lab‑fee receipts. | Enhances audit trail, supports AML compliance, improves cost‑center tracking. | High |
| 3. Implement a **Reconciliation Checklist** that flags any “UNKNOWN” payer entries for immediate investigation. | Reduces risk of untracked cash and strengthens internal controls. | Medium |
| 4. Periodically reconcile **wire‑fee deductions** against bank statements and update the tuition ledger accordingly. | Ensures consistent treatment of transaction costs across periods. | Medium |
| 5. Conduct a **post‑reconciliation review** with Treasury and Student Accounts to confirm that all fee adjustments are reflected in the financial statements. | Guarantees cross‑functional alignment and accurate financial reporting. | Low |

### IX. Conclusion  

- The reconciliation of the 5 Jan – 12 Jan 2026 tuition accruals to the 12 Jan 2026 bank deposits is **substantially complete**; only a single $50 variance exists, attributable to a wire‑transfer fee.  
- The “UNKNOWN” deposit is logically linked to the lab‑fee accrual for Sarah Jenkins, but the missing payer detail constitutes a control deficiency.  
- No missing tuition or scholarship entries were identified.  
- Implementing the recommendations will eliminate the $50 variance from the financial statements, reinforce internal controls, and support the institution’s strategic objectives of accurate revenue reporting and robust cash‑management practices.
