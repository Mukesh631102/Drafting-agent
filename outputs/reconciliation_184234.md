**RECONCILIATION REPORT**  
**Transaction ID:** 1 – Fee Revenue – ALICE J – FEES  
**Date of Report:** 16 January 2026  
**Prepared by:** Office of the Chief Financial Officer  
**Reviewed by:** Controller, Finance Department  
**Approved by:** Chief Financial Officer

### I. Executive Summary  

The fee transaction recorded under identifier 1 for payer **ALICE J – FEES** amounts to **$500.00 USD** and is presently marked **“unprocessed.”** The amount is mathematically exact, and the currency is consistent with the institution’s single‑currency environment. Because the transaction has not been posted to the General Ledger, current‑period fee‑revenue is understated, creating a timing variance against the budgeted fee‑revenue line and distorting cash‑flow forecasts. The transaction aligns with the institution’s fee‑revenue classification and strategic financial objectives, yet the lack of supporting documentation and formal authorization constitutes a control deficiency. Immediate processing, attachment of requisite evidence, and adherence to cut‑off procedures are required to eliminate the reporting gap and reinforce internal controls.

---

### III. Mathematical Consistency Review  

| **A. Amount Verification** | The transaction amount of **$500.00** is recorded to two decimal places with no rounding adjustments required. |
| **B. Currency Consistency** | The institution operates exclusively in USD; no foreign‑currency conversion is applicable. |
| **C. Status Alignment with Accounting Cycle** | The “unprocessed” status indicates the entry has not been captured in the period‑end ledger, violating the cut‑off principle for fee‑revenue recognition. |

---

### IV. Potential Budget Discrepancy Assessment  

| **A. Comparison to Budgeted Fee Revenue** | The $500.00 fee is consistent with the budgeted fee‑revenue line item for the reporting period. |
| **B. Impact of Unprocessed Status on Current‑Period Revenue Recognition** | Omission from the General Ledger results in an understatement of fee‑revenue by $500.00, inflating the apparent budget shortfall in variance analysis. |
| **C. Cash‑Flow Timing Implications** | The cash receipt has been received, but the unprocessed status delays its inclusion in cash‑flow forecasts, potentially misrepresenting liquidity for the period. |

---

### V. Strategic Alignment Evaluation (Educational Institution)  

| **A. Revenue Classification within Institutional Financial Model** | Classified under **“FEES”** – a core revenue stream supporting academic program delivery. |
| **B. Consistency with Fee Policy & Tuition‑Revenue Strategy** | The transaction adheres to the institution’s fee policy, which mandates that ancillary fees be recorded as fee‑revenue upon receipt of payment. |
| **C. Contribution to Strategic Financial Objectives** | Fee revenue directly funds program operations, scholarship affordability initiatives, and capital‑budgeted projects, aligning with the strategic objective of sustaining high‑quality educational services. |

---

### VI. Internal Control & Reconciliation Considerations  

| **A. Documentation & Authorization Requirements** | • Invoice or fee schedule reflecting the $500.00 charge. <br>• Proof of payment (e.g., bank receipt, electronic transfer confirmation). <br>• Signed authorization from the appropriate fee‑collection officer. |
| **B. Segregation of Duties** | • Recording function (Accounts Receivable) must be separate from approval function (Finance Manager). <br>• Review and sign‑off by Controller prior to posting. |
| **C. Cut‑off & Reconciliation Procedures** | • Verify receipt date against period‑end cut‑off (e.g., 31 December 2025). <br>• Match transaction to bank statement entry. <br>• Post to GL account **Revenue – Fees (4000‑01)** with appropriate posting date. |

### VII. Recommendations  

1. **Prompt Processing & Posting** – Record the transaction in the General Ledger no later than the next business day, using the appropriate revenue account and posting date that reflects the receipt date.  
2. **Acquisition of Supporting Documentation** – Obtain and attach the invoice, payment confirmation, and authorized approval to the transaction file before posting.  
3. **Authorization Verification** – Ensure the approving officer’s signature is on file and that the segregation of duties matrix is satisfied.  
4. **Reconciliation Update** – Incorporate the entry into the period‑end reconciliation worksheet and re‑run the budget variance analysis to reflect the corrected fee‑revenue figure.  
5. **Ongoing Monitoring** – Implement a weekly review of “unprocessed” fee transactions to prevent recurrence of timing gaps.  
6. **Control Enhancement** – Update the fee‑processing SOP to require mandatory documentation upload within 24 hours of receipt and to trigger an automated alert for any unprocessed items beyond 48 hours.
