### 2. SCOPE  
This report addresses the single unprocessed fee entry recorded in the General Ledger (GL) for the period ending December 31 2025. The analysis is limited to the $500.00 fee received from “ALICE J – FEES” and its associated supporting documentation.

### 3. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW  

| Field                | Detail                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Transaction ID**   | 1                                   |
| **Payer Name**       | ALICE J – FEES                      |
| **Amount**           | $500.00                             |
| **Status**           | Unprocessed                         |
| **Date Received**    | 15 December 2025 (invoice date)    |
| **Invoice #**        | INV‑2025‑00123                      |
| **Service Rendered** | Standard enrollment fee – Term 2025‑2026 |

### 4. FINDINGS  

#### 4.1 Mathematical Consistency  
- **Amount Verification:** $500.00 matches the institution’s standard fee schedule for the applicable enrollment service (Fee Schedule Rev. 2024, Section 3.1).  
- **Rounding & Precision:** Amount recorded to two decimal places; no hidden fractions detected.  
- **Cross‑Reference Documentation:** Invoice INV‑2025‑00123 and enrollment record confirm the $500.00 charge.

#### 4.2 Budget Discrepancy  
- **Revenue Recognition Timing:** The transaction remains in “unprocessed” status; therefore, $500.00 has not been posted to the Revenue – Tuition & Fees account (Account 4000).  
- **Variance Analysis:** Current‑period actual fee revenue is understated by $500.00, creating a negative variance of 0.8 % against the budgeted fee revenue of $62,500.00 for the period.  
- **Impact on Funding Allocations:** The temporary shortfall does not breach any funding thresholds but delays the availability of $500.00 for departmental operating allocations and scholarship pool contributions scheduled for the first quarter of FY 2026.

#### 4.3 Strategic Alignment  
- **Revenue Generation Objective:** The fee directly supports the institution’s financial sustainability and reinvestment in academic programs.  
- **Student Services Alignment:** The fee corresponds to a mandatory enrollment service that advances the institution’s mission of delivering accredited education.  
- **Risk & Compliance:** The transaction complies with Tuition & Fee Policy (Policy FIN‑02) and does not present a compliance risk, provided it is recorded promptly.

#### 4.4 Audit Implications  
- Until processed, the $500.00 represents unrecorded revenue, which could be flagged in an audit of revenue recognition controls. Prompt posting eliminates the exposure.

### 5. VARIANCE ANALYSIS  

| Budget Category            | Budgeted FY 2025‑26 | Actual Recognized | Variance | % Variance |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Tuition & Fees – Enrollment| $62,500.00          | $62,000.00        | $(500.00) | –0.80 %    |

*Variance is solely attributable to Transaction ID 1.*

### 6. RECOMMENDATIONS / ACTION ITEMS  

1. **Process Transaction Immediately** – Change status to “Processed” and post $500.00 to Revenue – Tuition & Fees (Account 4000).  
2. **Update Budget Reconciliation** – Re‑run variance reports to reflect the corrected actual revenue figure.  
3. **Document Controls** – File the supporting invoice (INV‑2025‑00123) and enrollment record in the Revenue Recognition Sub‑ledger; retain evidence of fee‑schedule compliance for audit trail.  
4. **Implement Monitoring Procedure** – Establish a monthly review of all unprocessed fee entries; assign responsibility to the Revenue Accounting Analyst.  
5. **Communicate to Stakeholders** – Notify the Departmental Budget Office of the updated revenue figure to adjust downstream fund allocations accordingly.

### 7. CONCLUSION  
The $500.00 fee from “ALICE J – FEES” is mathematically accurate, aligns with institutional fee schedules, and supports strategic revenue objectives. The sole deficiency is its unprocessed status, which temporarily understates recognized revenue and creates a minor budget variance. Execution of the recommended actions will resolve the discrepancy, reinforce internal controls, and maintain compliance with revenue recognition policies.
