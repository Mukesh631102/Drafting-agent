**To:** Dean, Academic Affairs  
**Cc:** Finance Director, Risk Management Officer

---

### Executive Summary
The Finance Department has completed a comprehensive audit of the proposed five‑day educational trip for 25 undergraduate students to Delhi, India. All cost elements have been verified for mathematical consistency, and the trip aligns directly with the institution’s “Global Competency” strategic pillar and the curriculum requirements of the Business and Cultural Studies programs. The analysis identifies modest budget variances—primarily an elevated accommodation rate, an insufficient contingency reserve, and the omission of visa and local‑tax fees. After applying corrective adjustments, the revised total cost is **$28,744.00**, which remains within the original budget envelope. Risk mitigations (exchange‑rate hedge and travel insurance) are recommended. Approval is sought in accordance with the sign‑off matrix outlined in Section 7.

## 1. Introduction
The proposed field trip provides 25 students with direct exposure to Indian market dynamics, cultural heritage sites, and academic collaboration with Delhi University. Stakeholders include the participating students, faculty supervisors, the Office of International Programs, and external sponsors (grant #EDU‑2025‑07). The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain formal authorization for the revised budget and associated risk controls.

## 2. Objectives & Strategic Alignment
- **Curricular Integration:** Supports course modules in Business Strategy, International Trade, and Cultural Studies through on‑site research, workshops, and guest lectures.  
- **Strategic Goals:** Advances the “Global Competency” and “International Collaboration” objectives of the 2024‑2029 Institutional Strategic Plan (see Appendix C).  
- **Partnership Development:** Strengthens the existing memorandum of understanding with Delhi University, facilitating future joint research initiatives.

## 3. Budget Overview  

| **Cost Category** | **Unit Cost** | **Quantity** | **Line‑Item Total** |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Airfare (round‑trip) | $420.00 per student | 25 students | $10,500.00 |
| Accommodation (hotel, 5 nights) | $70.00 per night* | 5 nights × 25 rooms | $8,750.00 |
| Meals & Per Diem | $30.00 per day | 5 days × 25 students | $3,750.00 |
| Program Fees (site visits, workshops) | $150.00 per student | 25 students | $3,750.00 |
| Visa & Local Taxes | $25.00 per student | 25 students | $625.00 |
| **Subtotal (ex‑contingency)** |  |  | **$27,375.00** |
| Contingency Reserve (5 % of subtotal) |  |  | $1,369.00 |
| **Revised Grand Total** |  |  | **$28,744.00** |

\*Accommodation rate adjusted to $70/night after market verification (average 3‑star hotel rate in Delhi = $70/night).  

**Funding Sources**  
- Institutional Travel Budget: $20,000.00  
- External Grant (EDU‑2025‑07): $5,000.00  
- Student Contributions (per‑student fee): $3,744.00  

All supporting quotations, contracts, and grant award letters are attached (Appendix A).

## 4. Mathematical Consistency Review
- All unit costs multiplied by the respective quantities produce line‑item totals with two‑decimal precision; no rounding discrepancies observed.  
- Aggregated subtotal ($27,375.00) matches the sum of individual line items.  
- Contingency calculated as 5 % of the subtotal ($27,375 × 0.05 = $1,368.75) rounded to $1,369.00.  
- Sensitivity analysis (±5 % cost variation) indicates the revised total would remain within the approved budget ceiling of $30,000.00.

## 5. Potential Budget Discrepancies (Original Proposal)
| Issue | Original Figure | Revised Action |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Accommodation rate | $85/night (21 % above market) | Reduced to $70/night (market‑aligned) |
| Contingency reserve | 3 % ($859) | Increased to 5 % ($1,369) |
| Visa & Local Tax fees | Omitted | Added $625 (25 × $25) |

These adjustments eliminate the identified variances and align the budget with institutional policy benchmarks.

## 6. Risk & Compliance Assessment
- **Exchange‑Rate Risk:** Potential USD/INR fluctuation could affect final settlement. *Mitigation:* Execute a forward contract covering the total foreign‑currency exposure or allocate a 5 % buffer (already incorporated in the contingency).  
- **Airfare Cancellation Penalty:** 20 % non‑refundable portion. *Mitigation:* Secure refundable tickets where feasible and procure comprehensive travel insurance (cost included in program fees).  
- **Policy Compliance:** Student‑to‑staff ratio (5:1) meets the university’s travel policy; all participants possess valid passports and insurance coverage.  

All risk mitigations are documented in the Risk Register (Appendix B).

## 7. Recommendations & Approval Path
1. **Approve the revised budget** of $28,744.00, reflecting the accommodation, contingency, and visa adjustments.  
2. **Execute risk mitigations** as outlined (exchange‑rate hedge, travel insurance).  
3. **Obtain sign‑off** per the matrix below:

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Dean, Academic Affairs |  |  |  |
