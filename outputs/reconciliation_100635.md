### I. Reconciliation Overview  

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Verify that all tuition‑related accruals (Source A) are reflected in cash receipts (Source B) for the period 5‑10 Jan 2026. |
| **Scope** | Student tuition fees, scholarship award, and ancillary laboratory fee. Excludes unrelated bank activity. |
| **Data Sources** | • **Source A** – Internal Tuition Ledger (accrual basis).<br>• **Source B** – Bank Deposit Statement (cash basis). |

### II. Matching Summary  

| Ledger ID | Student / Entity | Fee (Accrual) | Deposit Ref. | Payer (Bank) | Amount Received | Status |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| STU‑8821 | James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | Matched |
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | **Discrepancy** |
| STU‑4410 | TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | TechCorp | $12,000.00 | Matched |
| STU‑1125 | Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | R. Chen | $5,400.00 | Matched |
| STU‑5501 | Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | **UNKNOWN** | $2,100.00 | Matched (payer unidentified) |

### III. Discrepancy Analysis  

| Reference | Issue | Root Cause | Audit Implication |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia** | Cash receipt $5,350.00 vs. accrued fee $5,400.00 (‑$50.00) | Bank‑wire processing fee of $50.00 deducted by the remitting bank. | Tuition revenue remains $5,400.00; $50.00 must be recorded as “Bank Service Charges” (operating expense). |
| **STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee)** | Deposit payer listed as **UNKNOWN** | Payer name omitted on bank remittance (cash deposit or electronic transfer lacking reference). | Revenue is recognized, but lack of payer traceability indicates a control weakness in payment identification. |

---

### IV. Missing Entries  

* No tuition or scholarship accruals lack a corresponding cash receipt after accounting for the $50.00 wire fee.  
* No cash deposits remain unlinked after assigning the “UNKNOWN” deposit to STU‑5501.  

**Conclusion:** Reconciliation is complete; no missing entries identified.

---

### V. Mathematical Consistency  

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| **Total Accrued Tuition (Source A)** | $30,300.00 |
| **Total Cash Received (Source B)** | $30,250.00 |
| **Net Variance** | $50.00 (explained by wire‑fee deduction) |

The $50.00 variance is fully accounted for in the discrepancy analysis.

---

### VI. Budget Impact Assessment  

| Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Revenue Recognition** | Tuition revenue recorded at $30,300.00 (accrual). Cash inflow recorded at $30,250.00 after fee. |
| **Expense Implication** | $50.00 to be booked under “Bank Service Charges” – operating expense. |
| **Cash‑Flow Forecast** | $50.00 shortfall; negligible on overall budget but requires tracking for precise cash‑flow projection. |

---

### VII. Strategic Alignment  

1. **Revenue Integrity** – Complete matching sustains confidence in tuition‑revenue reporting.  
2. **Cash‑Flow Visibility** – Identification of bank fees improves liquidity forecasting.  
3. **Control Environment** – “UNKNOWN” payer highlights need for mandatory payer‑reference fields on all electronic transfers.  
4. **Student‑Service Alignment** – Traceable lab‑fee collections support accurate cost allocation to laboratory resources.  

---

### VIII. Recommendations  

1. **Record Bank‑Service Expense** – Post the $50.00 wire fee to “Bank Service Charges” in the period’s income statement.  
2. **Ledger Annotation** – Amend the tuition ledger to note the fee as a deduction from cash receipt, preserving full tuition revenue.  
3. **Payer‑Reference Protocol** – Implement mandatory reference codes on all electronic transfers to eliminate “UNKNOWN” deposits.  
4. **Reconciliation Controls** – Institute routine reconciliation of bank‑fee deductions and unknown payer entries.  
5. **Lab‑Fee Process Review** – Conduct periodic review of laboratory‑fee collection procedures to ensure payer identification and timely posting.  

---

### IX. Key Findings  

* Full matching achieved for four of five tuition items; the sole variance ($50) is a documented wire‑transfer fee.  
* Maria Garcia’s $50 discrepancy is attributable to a bank‑imposed wire fee; it should be recorded as an expense, not a revenue shortfall.  
* STU‑5501’s “UNKNOWN” deposit aligns with Sarah Jenkins’ lab fee; the missing payer name indicates a control gap in payment identification.  
* No missing ledger entries or unmatched cash deposits remain after adjustments; mathematical totals reconcile to a $50 variance explained by the fee.  
* Budget impact is limited to a $50 expense; consistent tracking of such fees is essential for accurate cash‑flow management.  
* Strengthening payer‑reference protocols and bank‑fee monitoring will support reliable financial reporting and operational budgeting.
