**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** Finance Committee  
**From:** [Name], Chief Financial Officer  
**Date:** 15 January 2026  
**Subject:** Reconciliation of Travel Expenditures – VIT Vellore Trip (10 Participants)  

---

### 1. Executive Summary  

The purpose of this memorandum is to reconcile the approved budget for the VIT Vellore research symposium trip (10 participants) with the actual expenditures incurred. The reconciliation confirms overall mathematical consistency but identifies a total variance of **$350 (7 %)** above the approved budget of **$5,000**. Primary drivers of the overrun are travel‑class upgrades, a duplicate conference‑registration entry, a rounding discrepancy in accommodation, and a shortfall in per‑diem documentation. Strategic alignment with institutional objectives remains strong; however, process gaps in expense substantiation and pre‑approval controls require remediation.

### 4. Reconciliation Overview  

#### 4.1 Budgeted vs. Actual Expenditures – Summary Table  

| Category                | Budgeted ($) | Actual ($) | Variance ($) | Comments |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Travel                  | 2,040.00     | 2,200.00   | **+160.00** (8 %) | Ticket upgrades not pre‑approved |
| Accommodation           | 367.66*      | 380.00     | **+12.34** (3.4 %) | Rounding discrepancy |
| Per‑Diem                | 1,500.00     | 1,470.00   | **‑30.00** (‑2 %) | Missing receipt for $30 |
| Conference Registration| 500.00       | 1,000.00   | **+500.00** (duplicate) | Two identical entries recorded |
| Miscellaneous Supplies  | 300.00       | 300.00     | 0.00          | No supporting documentation |
| Contingency / Other     | 292.34**     | 0.00       | **‑292.34** (unused) | Unused contingency fund |
| **Total**               | **5,000.00** | **5,350.00**| **+350.00** (7 %) | Overall overrun |

\* Accommodation budget reflects the amount after rounding adjustment.  
\** Contingency fund allocated to absorb unforeseen costs; remained unutilized.

#### 4.2 Detailed Line‑Item Comparison  

- **Travel:** Approved economy‑class airfare total **$2,040**. Actual tickets **$2,200** reflect last‑minute upgrades to business class (Δ +$160).  
- **Accommodation:** Budgeted **$367.66** (derived from cap of $660 after allocation to other categories). Actual hotel invoice **$380.00** – a rounding variance of **$12.34**.  
- **Per‑Diem:** Budgeted **$1,500** (10 × $150). Receipts substantiate **$1,470**; a shortfall of **$30** remains unaccounted.  
- **Conference Registration:** Approved registration fee **$500**. Two identical invoices of **$500** each were entered, inflating the recorded expense by **$500**.  
- **Miscellaneous Supplies:** Budgeted **$300**; expense recorded matches budget but lacks supporting invoices.  
- **Contingency/Other:** Budgeted **$292.34**; no expenditures were charged to this line item.

### 5. Mathematical Consistency Review  

1. **Verification of Totals:** All line‑item subtotals reconcile to the aggregate actual amount of **$5,350** within the acceptable tolerance of ±0.5 %.  
2. **Rounding & Allocation Checks:** The accommodation rounding discrepancy of **$12.34** is the only deviation beyond the tolerance threshold; it has been isolated and quantified.  
3. **Cross‑Reference with Documentation:** Each expense has been cross‑checked against the supporting invoice or receipt repository. Missing documentation is noted for per‑diem ($30) and miscellaneous supplies ($300).

### 6. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Issue | Impact | Policy Compliance | Recommended Action |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Travel‑class upgrades | +$160 (8 % overrun) | Violates pre‑approval travel‑class limit | Enforce pre‑approval workflow for any class upgrade |
| Duplicate registration entries | +$500 | Duplicate payment not authorized | Remove duplicate entry; adjust ledger |
| Accommodation rounding | +$12.34 | Minor rounding error | Correct allocation in the accounting system |
| Per‑diem shortfall | –$30 (under‑spend) | Missing receipt | Obtain missing receipt or adjust per‑diem claim |
| Miscellaneous supplies lacking documentation | $0 variance but non‑compliant | Insufficient evidence per policy | Request supporting invoices; if unavailable, reclassify or reverse expense |
| Unused contingency fund | –$292.34 | No breach; under‑utilization | Document rationale for non‑use; retain for future contingencies |

Overall, the variance of **$350** is material relative to the approved budget and stems primarily from the travel upgrade and duplicate registration entries.

### 7. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

1. **Alignment with Institutional Objectives** – The symposium directly supports the university’s strategic goal of enhancing industry‑academic collaboration and research visibility.  
2. **Cost‑Benefit Considerations** – Preliminary analysis estimates **1.8 learning units** per participant, translating to a marginal cost increase of **$35 per participant** (total overrun $350). The educational benefit outweighs the incremental cost.  
3. **Risk Assessment** – Health and safety protocols were observed; however, a formal contingency plan for travel disruptions was not documented.  
4. **Future Alignment Enhancements** – Early‑booking discounts and consolidated travel arrangements could reduce future travel costs by up to **10 %** without compromising strategic outcomes.

### 8. Recommendations  

#### 8.1 Immediate Corrective Actions  
- **Adjust Accommodation Allocation** – Amend the accounting entry to reflect the correct rounded amount.  
- **Obtain Missing Per‑Diem Receipt** – Request the $30 receipt from the participant; if unavailable, adjust the per‑diem claim accordingly.  
- **Remove Duplicate Registration Entry** – Reverse the erroneous $500 entry and re‑issue the corrected invoice.  
- **Document Miscellaneous Supplies** – Secure supporting invoices; if unavailable, reclassify the expense or seek approval for reversal.  

#### 8.2 Process Improvements  
- **Pre‑Approval Workflow for Travel Upgrades** – Implement an electronic approval matrix requiring finance sign‑off for any deviation from the approved travel class.  
- **Standardized Receipt Collection** – Enforce a policy that all per‑diem and miscellaneous expenses must be accompanied by original receipts within five business days of travel.  
- **Contingency Planning** – Develop a formal travel‑disruption contingency protocol, including pre‑identified alternate routes and insurance coverage.  

#### 8.3 Ongoing Monitoring & Reporting Enhancements  
- **Post‑Trip Evaluation** – Institute a post‑trip report capturing learning outcomes, cost‑benefit metrics, and participant feedback.  
- **Quarterly Variance Review** – Schedule quarterly reviews of travel‑related expenditures to detect and address emerging variances promptly.

### 9. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms that the VIT Vellore trip was executed in substantial alignment with the institution’s strategic objectives, delivering measurable educational value. Nevertheless, the **$350 (7 %)** budget overrun is material and attributable to identifiable control weaknesses—specifically, unauthorized travel upgrades and duplicate registration entries. Implementation of the recommended corrective actions and process enhancements will mitigate recurrence, strengthen compliance with financial policies, and improve fiscal stewardship for future academic travel.

**Audit Opinion:** *Unqualified* with *material variance* requiring remediation as outlined above.  

**Next Steps:** Finance staff to execute corrective actions within the next 30 days, report progress to the Finance Committee, and incorporate the post‑trip evaluation into the next strategic planning cycle.
