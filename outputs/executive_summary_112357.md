### 1. Executive Summary  

**1.1 Purpose of the Review**  
To evaluate the completeness and reliability of the institution’s financial obligations for the current fiscal year, assess the adequacy of audit coverage, and determine the impact of identified variances on strategic objectives and compliance requirements.  

**1.2 Scope and Limitations**  
- Scope: Review of the “Total Due” ($5,500 000) versus “Total Found” ($2,850 000) as presented in the latest internal audit report.  
- Sample: Data extracted from the central budgeting system and supporting subsidiary ledgers as of 31 December 2025.  
- Limitations: The analysis is confined to the data set provided; any obligations outside the audited sample are not reflected.  

**1.3 Core Financial Metrics**  

| Metric                | Amount (USD) | % of Total Due |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Total Due             | $5,500,000   | 100.0 %        |
| Total Found           | $2,850,000   | 51.8 %         |
| Audit Coverage        | —            | 51.8 %         |
| Unverified Obligations| $2,650,000   | 48.2 %         |

### 2. Data Validation & Mathematical Consistency  

**2.1 Source Verification**  
- “Total Due” and “Total Found” figures were traced to the institution’s master budget and the audit work‑paper register, respectively. Both sources are authorized and signed off by the Controller.  

**2.2 Re‑calculation of Audit Coverage**  
- Formula applied: Coverage = (Total Found ÷ Total Due) × 100%  
- Computation: (2,850,000 ÷ 5,500,000) × 100% = 0.5182 × 100% = 51.82 % → reported as 51.8 %.  

**2.3 Cross‑check of Rounding and Presentation Consistency**  
- All monetary values are presented to the nearest thousand dollars; percentages are rounded to one decimal place. No rounding discrepancies or presentation errors were identified.

### 3. Budget Discrepancy Assessment  

**3.1 Quantification of Shortfall**  
- Shortfall = Total Due − Total Found = $5,500,000 − $2,850,000 = $2,650,000, representing 48.2 % of total obligations.  

**3.2 Potential Sources of Discrepancy**  
- **Unrecorded liabilities or commitments** – obligations incurred after the reporting date or omitted from the ledger.  
- **Timing differences** – accrual‑basis entries not yet reflected in cash‑basis reporting.  
- **Incomplete data capture** – limited audit sample size resulting in omitted transactions.  

**3.3 Impact Analysis**  
- **Financial Statements:** The unverified $2.65 million may lead to understatement of liabilities and overstatement of net assets.  
- **Cash‑flow Forecasting:** Potential cash‑outflows are not fully projected, increasing the risk of liquidity shortfalls.  
- **Reserve Adequacy:** Current reserve calculations may be insufficient to cover the unverified obligations, jeopardizing financial resilience.

### 4. Strategic Alignment for an Educational Institution  

**4.1 Alignment of Available Funds with Institutional Mission**  
- Verified funds ($2.85 million) support core program delivery, scholarship awards, and ongoing capital projects.  
- The unverified portion ($2.65 million) threatens the ability to fully fund these mission‑critical activities.  

**4.2 Risk to Strategic Objectives**  
- **Program Under‑funding:** Potential curtailment of academic initiatives and reduced student services.  
- **Accreditation Compliance:** Inadequate verification of financial obligations may breach accreditation standards that require high‑confidence financial reporting.  
- **Capital Project Delays:** Insufficient assurance on funding may postpone infrastructure improvements.  

**4.3 Funding Adequacy Relative to Strategic Plan Milestones**  
- Current verified funding covers approximately 52 % of the budgeted commitments for FY 2025‑26.  
- Milestones tied to the strategic plan (e.g., new scholarship endowments, facility upgrades) are at risk of non‑fulfillment without remediation.

### 5. Recommendations  

**5.1 Immediate Actions**  
- **Expand Audit Scope:** Increase coverage to ≥ 90 % of total obligations to achieve an acceptable assurance level for a higher‑education entity.  
- **Reconcile Shortfall:** Conduct targeted inquiries and supplemental testing to identify and record the $2.65 million variance.  

**5.2 Medium‑Term Controls**  
- **Periodic Variance Analysis:** Institute quarterly variance reviews between budgeted and actual obligations, with escalation protocols for material deviations.  
- **Enhanced Documentation:** Strengthen the capture and retention of contingent liabilities, purchase orders, and commitment letters.  

**5.3 Strategic Enhancements**  
- **Integrated Budget‑Strategic Planning Cycle:** Align budgeting timelines with the institution’s multi‑year strategic plan to ensure financial resources are synchronized with mission objectives.  
- **Financial‑Risk Register:** Develop and maintain a register to monitor unverified obligations, assess probability and impact, and assign mitigation actions.

### Key Findings  

- **Mathematical Consistency:** Audit coverage of 51.8 % is accurately derived from the reported totals; no computational errors detected.  
- **Budget Discrepancy:** A substantive shortfall of $2.65 million (48.2 % of obligations) remains unaccounted for, indicating potential unrecorded liabilities, timing mismatches, or incomplete data capture.  
- **Strategic Alignment Concerns:** The unverified portion jeopardizes funding for core educational programs, scholarships, and capital projects, exposing the institution to strategic and compliance risks.  
- **Risk Exposure:** Coverage just above the 50 % threshold falls short of the high‑confidence assurance required for accreditation and stakeholder confidence.  
- **Action Imperative:** Broadening audit scope, reconciling the variance, and instituting robust monitoring controls are essential to mitigate financial‑statement risk and sustain alignment with strategic goals.
