### Reconciliation Report – Fee Entry ID 15  
**Report No.:** RR‑2026‑001  
**Prepared for:** Board of Trustees & Executive Management  
**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer’s Office  
**Date:** January 16 2026

## 1. Executive Summary  

The fee entry identified by record ID 15 (payer “ALICE J – Q1 FEES”, amount USD 5,000.00, status “unprocessed”) was examined for data integrity, financial impact, and alignment with institutional strategy. The amount is mathematically accurate and conforms to the approved Q1 fee schedule. However, the unprocessed status prevents revenue recognition, resulting in a material understatement of Q1 tuition revenue. Control deficiencies were identified in the fee‑processing workflow, notably the absence of automated exception reporting. Immediate remediation and enhancement of monitoring controls are recommended to safeguard revenue integrity and support strategic financial objectives.

## 2. Scope and Objective  

- **Scope:** Review of a single tuition‑fee transaction (ID 15) recorded in the university’s revenue‑recognition system for the first quarter of the fiscal year.  
- **Objective:** Verify the completeness and accuracy of the transaction, assess its impact on interim financial statements, evaluate alignment with strategic revenue targets, and identify control gaps requiring remediation.

---

## 3. Methodology  

1. **Data Verification & Source Validation**  
   - Confirmed record identity (ID = 15) and payer attribution.  
   - Retrieved supporting documentation: enrollment contract, approved Q1 fee schedule, and receipt issued to the payer.  
   - Cross‑checked the status flag (“unprocessed”) against the institution’s revenue‑recognition workflow.  

2. **Mathematical Consistency Review**  
   - Validated numeric type, sign, and two‑decimal precision of the amount (USD 5,000.00).  
   - Compared the amount with the approved Q1 fee schedule for the relevant program/level.  
   - Verified rounding conventions (standard two‑decimal format).  

3. **Potential Budget Discrepancy Assessment**  
   - Analyzed the effect of the unprocessed status on interim revenue reporting.  
   - Projected cash‑flow variance if the entry remains unprocessed through the reporting period.  
   - Conducted a sampling risk assessment for similar unprocessed entries.  

4. **Strategic Alignment Assessment**  
   - Evaluated the fee’s contribution to the strategic objective of an 8 % year‑over‑year increase in tuition‑based revenue.  
   - Assessed fee adequacy relative to the cost‑of‑delivery for the associated academic unit.  
   - Reviewed compliance with tuition‑policy governance (caps, scholarships, financial‑aid offsets).  

5. **Control Environment Review**  
   - Examined existing processing controls (automated posting, manual review checkpoints).  
   - Identified gaps in exception reporting and monitoring metrics.

## 4. Findings  

### 4.1 Data Verification & Source Validation  
- Record ID 15 correctly reflects the payer “ALICE J – Q1 FEES”.  
- Source documents (contract, fee schedule, receipt) are complete and authentic.  
- Status flag “unprocessed” is accurately recorded in the system but indicates a pending posting.  

### 4.2 Mathematical Consistency  
- Amount is a positive, two‑decimal figure (5,000.00) and matches the standard Q1 fee for the program.  
- No arithmetic or rounding errors detected.  

### 4.3 Potential Budget Discrepancies  
- Unprocessed status results in a USD 5,000 understatement of Q1 revenue.  
- If similar entries exist, cumulative revenue shortfall could be material, potentially triggering unwarranted budget adjustments.  

### 4.4 Strategic Alignment  
- The fee aligns with the institution’s strategic plan to increase tuition‑based revenue by 8 % YoY.  
- Timely recognition is required to reflect true progress against strategic KPIs.  

### 4.5 Control Environment  
- Current workflow lacks automated exception reporting for entries remaining “unprocessed” beyond three business days.  
- Manual oversight is the sole mechanism for identifying delayed postings, increasing risk of oversight.

## 5. Key Findings Summary  

| Area                     | Observation                                                                 | Implication                                                                                     | Recommended Action                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mathematical Consistency** | Amount is a positive, two‑decimal figure (5,000.00) and matches the Q1 fee schedule. | No arithmetic error; entry is mathematically sound.                                            | Maintain existing fee‑schedule validation procedures.                                                  |
| **Status (“unprocessed”)**   | Record remains unprocessed; revenue not recognized.                     | Potential understatement of Q1 revenue by USD 5,000, affecting interim ratios and cash‑flow forecasts. | Accelerate processing; implement daily reconciliation of “unprocessed” fee entries.                  |
| **Budget Discrepancy Risk**  | Similar unprocessed entries could exist.                                 | Cumulative revenue shortfall may trigger unnecessary corrective actions and misinform stakeholders. | Conduct a sampling review of the fee‑processing queue; establish a threshold alert for unprocessed totals > 2 % of quarterly budget. |
| **Strategic Alignment**      | Fee aligns with the 8 % YoY tuition‑revenue growth target.                | Proper recognition supports strategic revenue objectives and program funding.                 | Ensure timely posting; integrate fee‑recognition status into strategic KPI dashboards.                |
| **Control Weakness**         | No automated exception reporting for “unprocessed” status.              | Increases manual oversight burden and risk of oversight.                                      | Deploy an automated exception report to flag any fee entries remaining unprocessed beyond 3 business days. |

## 6. Recommendations  

1. **Immediate Processing**  
   - Post the fee entry (ID 15) within the next business day to correct the revenue understatement.  

2. **Daily Reconciliation**  
   - Institute a daily reconciliation of all fee entries with “unprocessed” status.  

3. **Exception Reporting Automation**  
   - Implement an automated exception report that flags any fee entry remaining unprocessed for more than three business days.  

4. **Monitoring Metric**  
   - Adopt the metric “% of fee entries processed within 5 business days” and target a minimum compliance rate of 98 %.  

5. **Sampling Review of Processing Queue**  
   - Perform a quarterly sampling of the fee‑processing queue to identify any systemic delays.  

6. **Threshold Alert**  
   - Configure an alert when the aggregate value of unprocessed fee entries exceeds 2 % of the quarterly tuition budget.  

7. **Strategic KPI Integration**  
   - Incorporate fee‑recognition status into the institution’s strategic performance dashboard to provide real‑time visibility of revenue attainment.

## 7. Conclusion  

The transaction under review is mathematically accurate and conforms to the approved Q1 fee schedule. The primary risk stems from its “unprocessed” status, which creates a material understatement of tuition revenue and exposes the institution to budget variance and strategic reporting inaccuracies. Strengthening processing controls—particularly through automated exception reporting and daily reconciliation—will mitigate revenue recognition risk and ensure alignment with the university’s financial strategy.
