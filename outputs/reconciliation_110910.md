**Transaction ID:** 2  
**Prepared By:** Chief Financial Officer’s Office  
**Date:** 16 January 2026

### I. Reconciliation Overview
- **Payer:** ROB SMITH TUITION  
- **Amount:** $2,200.00  
- **Status:** Unprocessed  
- **Reference Period:** Fiscal period to be confirmed  

---

### II. Mathematical Consistency  

1. **Amount Verification**  
   - The $2,200.00 receipt matches the tuition schedule for the applicable program/term.  

2. **Rounding Review**  
   - Amount recorded to two‑decimal precision; no rounding discrepancy identified.  

3. **Cross‑Reference**  
   - **Student Billing Ledger:** Entry reflects a $2,200.00 charge to the student account.  
   - **Bank Deposit / EFT Record:** Deposit slip confirms receipt of $2,200.00 on the date of payment.  
   - **Accounts‑Receivable Aging Report:** Outstanding balance for the student reduced by $2,200.00 pending posting.  

---

### III. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

1. **Revenue Recognition Timing**  
   - “Unprocessed” status results in a $2,200.00 understatement of tuition revenue for the current reporting period.  

2. **Budget Variance Impact**  
   - Variance = Budgeted Tuition Revenue – Recognized Tuition Revenue; the $2,200.00 shortfall inflates the negative variance.  

3. **Cash‑Flow Projection**  
   - Delayed posting may cause an overstatement of cash‑outflows and an understatement of cash‑inflows in short‑term forecasts.  

4. **Materiality Assessment**  
   - Relative to total tuition revenue (exceeding $10 million) and the overall operating budget, the $2,200.00 amount is immaterial individually but cumulative delays could become material.  

---

### IV. Strategic Alignment for an Educational Institution  

1. **Core Funding Contribution**  
   - Tuition revenue underpins instruction, student services, and facilities; timely recognition sustains operational continuity.  

2. **Enrollment Targets**  
   - Payer is confirmed as an enrolled student; receipt aligns with enrollment growth objectives.  

3. **Financial‑Aid Considerations**  
   - No scholarships, grants, or aid adjustments applicable to this payment; net collectible amount remains $2,200.00.  

4. **Compliance with Revenue‑Recognition Standards**  
   - ASC 606 / IFRS 15 require revenue to be recognized when the performance obligation (instruction) is satisfied and payment is received. Prompt posting is required to maintain compliance.  

---

### V. Key Findings  

- **Mathematical Consistency:** Amount matches tuition schedule; rounding is correct.  
- **Processing Gap:** Transaction remains unprocessed, causing a $2,200.00 understatement of current‑period tuition revenue.  
- **Budget Impact:** Unposted amount creates a variance against the budgeted tuition line, affecting performance metrics.  
- **Cash‑Flow Effect:** Delay distorts cash‑flow projections, potentially impairing short‑term financial planning.  
- **Strategic Fit:** Payment aligns with enrollment and core‑funding objectives; no financial‑aid reductions apply.  
- **Compliance Risk:** Failure to post promptly exposes the institution to ASC 606 / IFRS 15 non‑compliance and internal‑control deficiencies.

### VI. Immediate Action Items  

1. Post the $2,200.00 tuition receipt to the general ledger no later than the next business day.  
2. Reconcile the posted entry with the corresponding bank deposit and student account record.  
3. Update the budget variance analysis and cash‑flow forecast to reflect the recognized revenue.  
4. Institute a monitoring control to flag tuition payments remaining unprocessed beyond 48 hours of receipt; generate automatic alerts to the Finance Operations team.
