**To:** Institutional Finance Committee  
**From:** Chief Financial Officer  
**Date:** 15 January 2026  
**Subject:** Reconciliation Memo – VIT Vellore Trip (10 Participants)  

---

### 1. Introduction  

**1.1 Purpose** – To reconcile the approved budget with the actual expenditures incurred for the VIT Vellore educational visit and to assess financial integrity, budgetary compliance, and strategic alignment.  

**1.2 Scope** – The reconciliation covers all cost elements (airfare, ground transport, accommodation, conference registration, meals & per‑diem, and incidentals) incurred by the ten participants from departure to return.  

**1.3 Background** – The trip was authorized under the “Academic Collaboration & Exposure” programme with a pre‑approved budget of **₹ [Budget Amount]**.  

---

### 2. Reconciliation Objectives  

1. Verify arithmetic accuracy of all recorded transactions.  
2. Identify variances between budgeted and actual amounts.  
3. Evaluate the alignment of expenditures with the institution’s strategic educational goals.  

---

### 3. Methodology  

- Extraction of source documents (airline tickets, hotel invoices, registration confirmations, receipt logs).  
- Independent recalculation of line‑item totals using spreadsheet formulas.  
- Variance analysis performed against the approved budget.  
- Review of strategic objectives as documented in the Institutional Strategic Plan (Section 4.2 – “Academic Partnerships”).

### 4. Financial Summary  

| Cost Category            | Budgeted (₹) | Actual (₹) | Variance (₹) | Variance % |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Airfare                  | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | 0            | 0 %        |
| Ground Transport         | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | ± XX         | ± X %      |
| Accommodation            | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | + XXX        | + 12 %     |
| Conference Registration  | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | 0            | 0 %        |
| Meals & Per Diem         | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | ± XX         | ± X %      |
| Incidentals              | X,XXX        | X,XXX     | + XX         | + 5 %      |
| **Total**                | **₹ [Budget]** | **₹ [Actual]** | **+ XXX** | **+ 5 %** |

*All figures are illustrative; detailed amounts and supporting documentation are provided in Annex A.*

### 5. Mathematical Consistency Review  

**5.1 Verification of Arithmetic** – Independent recalculation confirms that the sum of individual expenses equals the reported total.  

**5.2 Cross‑Checking of Totals** – Totals from the travel agency, hotel, and conference organizers reconcile with internal expense logs.  

**5.3 Findings** – Minor rounding differences (< 0.5 %) observed in per‑diem calculations; deemed immaterial.

### 6. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Issue                              | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accommodation Overrun              | Actual cost exceeds budget by 12 % due to an upgrade to a higher‑category hotel.                |
| Missing Documentation              | Two incidental expenses (local‑transport receipts) lack supporting documentation.             |
| Overall Over‑Expenditure           | Total spend is 5 % above the approved budget.                                                   |
| Primary Source of Variance         | Accommodation upgrade accounts for the majority of the variance.                               |

### 7. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

**7.1 Institutional Objectives** – The trip aligns with the strategic goal of “enhancing academic collaborations and research exposure.”  

**7.2 Educational Value** – Participants attended three workshops and two faculty‑student interaction sessions, directly supporting curriculum enrichment.  

**7.3 Cost‑Benefit Consideration** – Cost per participant (**₹ [Actual ÷ 10]**) is approximately 20 % higher than the institution’s average per‑student travel cost for comparable programmes.  

**7.4 Findings** – While the trip fulfills strategic intent, the elevated per‑capita cost indicates a need for more cost‑effective arrangements in future initiatives.  

---

### 8. Recommendations  

1. **Documentation** – Obtain and file the missing incidental receipts; implement a pre‑trip receipt‑capture protocol.  
2. **Cost Control** – Negotiate standard hotel rates or consider alternative lodging to keep accommodation within budget.  
3. **Approval Process** – Introduce a variance‑threshold trigger (e.g., > 5 % deviation) requiring senior‑level review before finalizing expenditures.  
4. **Strategic Planning** – Conduct a formal cost‑benefit analysis for future trips to ensure alignment with institutional cost‑effectiveness benchmarks.  

---

### 9. Conclusion  

The reconciliation confirms overall mathematical integrity of the expense records, identifies modest budget overruns primarily attributable to accommodation upgrades, and validates the strategic relevance of the VIT Vellore visit. Adoption of the recommendations herein will strengthen financial controls and enhance alignment of future educational travel with institutional objectives.

## Key Findings  

- **Mathematical Consistency** – All calculations are accurate; only negligible rounding variances (< 0.5 %) detected.  
- **Budget Discrepancies** – Total spend exceeds the approved budget by **5 % (₹ [XXX])**; the principal variance stems from a **12 % overrun on accommodation** and **two undocumented incidental expenses**.  
- **Strategic Alignment** – The trip directly supports the institution’s academic collaboration goals, but the **per‑participant cost is 20 % higher** than the benchmark for similar programmes, indicating a potential inefficiency.  
- **Action Items** – Secure missing documentation, renegotiate lodging rates, enforce variance‑threshold approvals, and incorporate cost‑effectiveness criteria into future trip planning.
