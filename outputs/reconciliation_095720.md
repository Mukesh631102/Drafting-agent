### 1. Reconciliation Overview  

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Confirm that all tuition‑related receivables recorded in the internal tuition ledger (Source A) are reflected in the bank deposit statement (Source B). |
| **Scope** | Tuition fees, scholarship payments, and ancillary laboratory fees for the period 5‑10 January 2026. |
| **Methodology** | 1. Perform a side‑by‑side comparison of each ledger entry with the corresponding bank deposit.<br>2. Identify and document any variances.<br>3. Aggregate totals for both sources and compute net variance.<br>4. Assess control implications and recommend corrective actions. |

### 2. Transaction Matching  

| Ledger (Source A) | Bank Deposit (Source B) | Amount (USD) | Match Status | Comments |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| STU‑8821 – James Wilson | DEP‑001 – J. Wilson | 5,400.00 | ✅ Matched | Exact amount |
| STU‑9902 – Maria Garcia | DEP‑002 – Maria Garcia | 5,350.00 | ⚠️ Discrepancy | $50.00 short (wire‑fee deducted) |
| STU‑4410 – TechCorp Scholarship | DEP‑003 – TechCorp | 12,000.00 | ✅ Matched | Exact amount |
| STU‑1125 – Robert Chen | DEP‑004 – R. Chen | 5,400.00 | ✅ Matched | Exact amount |
| STU‑5501 – Sarah Jenkins (Lab Fee) | DEP‑005 – UNKNOWN | 2,100.00 | ✅ Matched (payer unknown) | Deposit recorded without payer name |

---

### 3. Discrepancy Analysis  

#### 3.1 Maria Garcia – $50.00 Shortfall  
*Source B* notes “Wire Fee Deducted.” The $50 represents a bank service charge applied to the wire transfer and does **not** reflect a tuition shortfall.  

#### 3.2 STU‑5501 – UNKNOWN Deposit  
The $2,100 deposit matches the lab‑fee amount recorded for Sarah Jenkins. The absence of a payer name in the bank statement is a documentation lapse; the underlying transaction is otherwise complete.

---

### 4. Missing Entries  

- No tuition, scholarship, or ancillary‑fee entries are absent from either source.  
- The only variance is the $50 wire‑fee deduction; no unrecorded deposits were identified.

---

### 5. Quantitative Consistency  

| Calculation | Amount (USD) |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Total Expected (Source A)** | 5,400 + 5,400 + 12,000 + 5,400 + 2,100 = **30,300** |
| **Total Received (Source B)** | 5,400 + 5,350 + 12,000 + 5,400 + 2,100 = **30,250** |
| **Net Variance** | **‑50** (explained by wire‑fee) |

---

### 6. Budget Impact Assessment  

1. **Wire‑Fee Expense** – The $50 service charge reduces cash inflow and should be recorded as a bank‑service expense, offset against the tuition receivable for Maria Garcia.  
2. **Unidentified Payer** – The omission of Sarah Jenkins’ name on DEP‑005 poses a risk of mis‑allocation of revenue and may affect cash‑flow forecasting and internal reporting.

---

### 7. Strategic Alignment Review  

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| **Revenue Recognition** | Accrual of tuition fees aligns with institutional policy; deposit confirmations substantiate cash receipt. |
| **Scholarship Handling** | Scholarship payment captured accurately; no variance detected. |
| **Ancillary Fees** | Lab fee captured; payer‑identification controls require strengthening to maintain data integrity. |

---

### 8. Recommendations  

1. **Record Wire Fee** – Post a $50 bank‑service expense and adjust Maria Garcia’s tuition receivable accordingly.  
2. **Correct Payer Attribution** – Amend DEP‑005 to reflect Sarah Jenkins as the payer; update the bank‑reconciliation worksheet.  
3. **Enhance Deposit Documentation** – Mandate inclusion of payer name on all incoming wires; implement a verification step prior to ledger posting.  
4. **Periodic Reconciliation** – Conduct monthly ledger‑to‑bank reconciliations to detect and resolve variances promptly.  
5. **Control Testing** – Perform a follow‑up audit of the cash‑receipt process to ensure consistent application of the above controls.

---

### 9. Conclusion  

The reconciliation is materially complete. The $50 variance is fully explained by a bank‑service charge and does not represent a tuition shortfall. No missing tuition entries are identified. Implementation of the recommended corrective actions will improve financial accuracy, ensure proper expense recognition, and strengthen internal controls over cash receipt documentation.

### Key Findings  

- **$50 Discrepancy** – Attributable to a wire‑transfer fee on Maria Garcia’s payment.  
- **UNKNOWN Deposit** – Matches Sarah Jenkins’ $2,100 lab fee; payer name omitted in bank reporting.  
- **Total Cash Received** – $30,250, $50 less than the $30,300 tuition revenue recorded in the ledger.  
- **Missing Entries** – None detected beyond the $50 service‑fee variance.  
- **Budget Implications** – Wire fee to be recorded as expense; payer‑identification weakness to be remedied.  
- **Strategic Alignment** – Tuition and scholarship revenues properly accrued; payer‑identification processes require reinforcement.
