### 2. Mathematical Consistency  

- **Fee Schedule Verification** – The $500.00 amount corresponds to the “Standard Enrollment Fee – Undergraduate” as listed in the approved Fee Schedule (Version 2025‑03). No deviation from the schedule is identified.  
- **Component Breakdown** – The fee comprises:  
  - Tuition Component: $400.00  
  - Laboratory Component: $80.00  
  - Materials Component: $20.00  
  The sum of the components equals the recorded total ($400 + $80 + $20 = $500.00).  
- **Rounding & Currency** – All amounts are recorded in U.S. dollars to two decimal places. No rounding adjustments or currency conversion factors are applicable.  

**Conclusion:** The transaction amount is mathematically sound and aligns with the institutional fee structure.

### 3. Budget Impact Assessment  

| Assessment Item                              | Observation |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Budget Line Mapping**                      | Mapped to Budget Line 4100 – “Student Fees – Enrollment”. |
| **General Ledger Posting**                   | No GL entry recorded; status remains unprocessed, creating a timing variance. |
| **Duplicate Entry Check**                    | Search of GL for $500.00 entries on 12‑13 Jan 2026 returned no duplicates. |
| **Timing Variance**                          | Cash receipt is recognized; revenue recognition is delayed pending processing, resulting in a temporary understatement of “Student Fees” revenue for the current reporting period. |
| **Variance Implication**                     | Potential under‑statement of $500.00 in the period‑end variance analysis for “Student Fees”. |

**Conclusion:** The unprocessed status introduces a material timing discrepancy that must be resolved to maintain accurate budget reporting.

### 4. Strategic Alignment  

- **Revenue Strategy** – The fee is classified as a core enrollment revenue stream, directly supporting the institution’s financial sustainability objectives. |
- **Program Funding** – Revenue from this fee contributes to the operating budget of the undergraduate program, aligning with the strategic plan to expand enrollment capacity. |
- **Policy Compliance** – The fee conforms to the Tuition and Fees Policy (Policy #TF‑2024‑01). No scholarship or financial‑aid offsets have been applied to this transaction. |
- **Risk Consideration** – Delayed processing may affect cash‑flow forecasts and performance metrics tied to enrollment revenue. |

**Conclusion:** Proper classification and timely processing of the fee are essential to uphold strategic revenue targets and policy compliance.

### 5. Key Findings  

1. **Mathematical Consistency** – Amount is accurate; component totals reconcile without rounding issues.  
2. **Budget Discrepancy** – Unprocessed status creates a timing variance that understates “Student Fees” revenue for the current period. No duplicate posting detected.  
3. **Strategic Alignment** – Fee aligns with institutional revenue strategy and complies with applicable policies.  

Overall, the transaction is valid but requires immediate processing to eliminate timing gaps and ensure accurate financial reporting.
