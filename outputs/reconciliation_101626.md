**TUITION RECEIVABLE RECONCILIATION**  
**Period:** January 5 – 10 2026  
**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer’s Office  
**Date:** January 14 2026

### 1. Scope & Objectives  

- Reconcile the internal tuition ledger (accrual basis) with the bank deposit statement (cash basis) for the period Jan 5‑10 2026.  
- Identify, quantify, and document any variances, missing entries, or exceptions.  
- Assess the impact of identified variances on revenue recognition, cash‑flow forecasting, and internal controls.

### 2. Data Sources  

| Source | Description | Date Range |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **A – Internal Tuition Ledger (Accrual)** | Student and scholarship fee records; status = Pending | Jan 5‑10 2026 |
| **B – Bank Deposit Statement (Cash)** | Actual cash receipts, including notes on fees/unknown payers | Jan 12 2026 |

---

### 3. Reconciliation Methodology  

1. **Transaction Matching** – Align each ledger ID (Source A) with the corresponding bank deposit reference (Source B) using payer name and fee amount.  
2. **Variance Analysis** – Flag any amount differences greater than $0.00.  
3. **Exception Review** – Investigate “UNKNOWN” payer entries and any unmatched ledger items.  
4. **Aggregate Validation** – Compare total accrued fees with total cash received, adjusting for documented fees.

### 4. Reconciliation Results  

| Ledger ID (Source A) | Payer (Ledger) | Fee (Accrued) | Deposit Ref (Source B) | Payer (Deposit) | Amount Received | Variance |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| STU‑8821 | James Wilson | $5,400.00 | DEP‑001 | J. Wilson | $5,400.00 | $0.00 |
| STU‑9902 | Maria Garcia | $5,400.00 | DEP‑002 | Maria Garcia | $5,350.00 | **‑$50.00** |
| STU‑4410 | TechCorp Scholarship | $12,000.00 | DEP‑003 | TechCorp | $12,000.00 | $0.00 |
| STU‑1125 | Robert Chen | $5,400.00 | DEP‑004 | R. Chen | $5,400.00 | $0.00 |
| STU‑5501 (Lab Fee) | Sarah Jenkins | $2,100.00 | DEP‑005 | UNKNOWN | $2,100.00 | $0.00 |

All five ledger items have a corresponding deposit; no unmatched ledger or deposit entries remain.

### 5. Detailed Findings  

1. **Maria Garcia – $50 Discrepancy**  
   - Deposit note: “Wire Fee Deducted.”  
   - Net receipt ($5,350) = Gross fee ($5,400) – Wire‑transfer fee ($50).  
   - The accrual record does not reflect the processing fee; net tuition revenue is overstated by $50.  

2. **STU‑5501 – “UNKNOWN” Deposit**  
   - Amount received ($2,100) matches the lab fee recorded for Sarah Jenkins.  
   - The payer omitted identification on the bank statement, likely a third‑party or internal transfer.  
   - No alternative ledger entry corresponds to $2,100; logical match confirmed.  

3. **Missing / Unmatched Entries**  
   - No ledger items remain unmatched.  
   - No additional deposits beyond the five listed.  
   - Consequently, no missing cash receipts are identified.

### 6. Mathematical Consistency Assessment  

- **Total Accrued Fees (Source A):**  
  $5,400 + $5,400 + $12,000 + $5,400 + $2,100 = **$30,300**  

- **Total Cash Received (Source B):**  
  $5,400 + $5,350 + $12,000 + $5,400 + $2,100 = **$30,250**  

- **Net Variance:** **‑$50**, fully explained by the wire‑transfer fee on Maria Garcia’s payment.  

After posting the $50 fee, the reconciliation is mathematically sound.

---

### 7. Potential Budget Impact  

- **Revenue Recognition:** Accrued tuition revenue is overstated by $50 until the fee is recorded as an expense.  
- **Expense Allocation:** The $50 should be classified under **Bank/Processing Fees** to reflect true net cash flow.  
- **Cash‑Flow Forecasting:** Inclusion of processing fees improves the accuracy of cash‑flow projections, particularly for ancillary revenue streams (e.g., lab fees).

### 8. Strategic Alignment Assessment  

| Area | Observation | Implication for Institutional Strategy |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Revenue Integrity** | Processing fee not captured in accruals. | Implement a standard deduction line for bank fees to align net tuition reporting with cash reality. |
| **Payer Identification** | “UNKNOWN” deposit for lab fee. | Strengthen payer‑identification protocols (mandatory reference field) to improve traceability and reduce audit risk. |
| **Scholarship & Third‑Party Payments** | TechCorp scholarship reconciled cleanly. | Maintain rigorous documentation of scholarship receipts to satisfy donor‑reporting requirements. |
| **Operational Controls** | Single, explained discrepancy identified. | Controls are effective; however, periodic review of fee‑deduction notices is recommended to pre‑empt similar variances. |

### 9. Recommendations / Action Items  

1. **Record Transaction Fee** – Debit **Bank Fees – Wire Transfer** $50 and credit **Tuition Receivable – Maria Garcia** $50 to align accrual with net cash received.  
2. **Enhance Deposit Reference Requirements** – Mandate inclusion of student ID or fee code on all incoming wires to eliminate “UNKNOWN” entries.  
3. **Update Reconciliation SOP** – Add a verification step for bank‑deducted fees before finalizing tuition accruals.  
4. **Periodic Variance Review** – Conduct monthly variance analysis to capture recurring processing fees or mismatches promptly.  

---

### 10. Conclusion  

The tuition receivable reconciliation for Jan 5‑10 2026 confirms that all accrued fees have corresponding cash receipts. The sole variance of $50 is attributable to a documented wire‑transfer fee and will be corrected through the recommended journal entry. No missing or unmatched entries were identified. The reconciliation is complete, mathematically consistent, and audit‑ready.
