### 1. Purpose & Scope  

The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain formal approval for a one‑time allocation of **Rs 50,000** to fund cultural activities for the upcoming academic year. The scope of the reconciliation includes verification of mathematical integrity, assessment of budgetary impact, and evaluation of strategic alignment with the school’s mission.

### 2. Reconciliation Summary  

- **Requested Amount:** Rs 50,000  
- **Source of Funds:** General Education Budget – Cultural Activities Sub‑line (FY 2025‑26)  
- **Supporting Documentation:**  
  - Fee schedule and vendor quotations  
  - Prior‑year cultural‑fees ledger (FY 2022‑24)  
  - Board of Governors approval minutes (Meeting dated [Insert Date])  
  - Excel ledger checksum report (checksum = 0)  

---

### 3. Mathematical Consistency  

- **Arithmetic Verification:** All line‑item totals (venue, materials, guest honoraria, transport) aggregate to **Rs 50,000** with no rounding discrepancies.  
- **Cross‑Check:** Totals reconcile with the underlying Excel ledger; checksum confirms zero variance.  
- **Variance Analysis:** No variance exceeds **0.5 %** between quoted amounts and recorded entries.

### 4. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Historical Comparison** | The current request is **12 %** higher than the three‑year average cultural‑fees outlay of **Rs 44,600**. |
| **Funding Gap** | The cultural sub‑line was originally budgeted at **Rs 45,000**. An additional **Rs 5,000** is required. |
| **Re‑allocation Source** | “Student Welfare” line shows an under‑utilization of **Rs 7,200**; re‑allocation of **Rs 5,000** is feasible without affecting core academic resources. |
| **Duplicate Entry Check** | No duplicate postings identified. A pending reimbursement of **Rs 2,000** for a prior event remains unclosed and must be cleared before posting the new expense. |

---

### 5. Strategic Alignment  

- **Mission Fit:** The cultural program directly supports SCTS School’s stated goal of “holistic development through arts and heritage.”  
- **Stakeholder Impact:** 2024 survey data indicate **85 %** of parents and students rate cultural activities as a “high priority.”  
- **Resource Allocation:** Re‑allocation from the under‑utilized “Student Welfare” line does not compromise academic or core operational funding, preserving strategic balance.  

---

### 6. Recommendations  

1. **Approve** the Rs 50,000 allocation, contingent upon re‑allocation of **Rs 5,000** from the “Student Welfare” line.  
2. **Clear** the outstanding **Rs 2,000** reimbursement before posting the new expense.  
3. **Document** the 12 % increase with a brief justification (e.g., expanded program scope) to maintain a complete audit trail for future reference.  

---

### 7. Conclusion  

The request for Rs 50,000 is mathematically sound, exhibits a modest budget variance that can be mitigated through internal re‑allocation, and aligns with the institution’s strategic objectives. Accordingly, approval is recommended subject to the conditions outlined above.
