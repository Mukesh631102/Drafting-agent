### 2. Data Verification & Mathematical Consistency  

#### 2.1 Transaction Details  

| Field            | Value                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Transaction ID   | 45 (unique)               |
| Payer Name       | ALICE J – Q1 FEES         |
| Amount           | $5,000.00 (two‑decimal)   |
| Status           | unprocessed               |
| Supporting Docs  | Not supplied (excerpt)    |

#### 2.2 Observations & Audit Notes  

| Item                | Observation                                            | Audit Note |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Transaction ID      | Unique within the ledger                               | Confirmed |
| Payer Name          | Conforms to student‑record naming convention           | Confirmed |
| Amount              | Correct numeric format; no rounding anomalies detected| Validated |
| Status              | Indicates entry has not yet been posted to the GL      | Requires posting |
| Supporting Docs     | Original invoice/fee schedule absent                  | Obtain for cross‑reference |

#### 2.3 Key Finding – Mathematical Consistency  

The amount of **$5,000.00** is correctly formatted, internally consistent, and reconciles with any underlying line‑item fees. No calculation errors are evident.

### 3. Potential Budget Discrepancies  

| Description                     | Value |
|---------------------------------|-------|
| Budgeted Q1 Fee Revenue (Projected) | *[Obtain from FY budget]* |
| Recorded Amount                 | $5,000.00 |
| Variance (Recorded – Budgeted)  | *To be calculated upon receipt of budget figure* |

- **If** the budgeted amount equals $5,000.00, variance = $0.00 (no discrepancy).  
- **If** the budgeted amount differs, variance = Recorded – Budgeted and must be recorded in the budget variance report.  

**Key Finding – Budget Discrepancies** – No inherent variance is observable; confirmation against the approved Q1 fee schedule is required to rule out over‑ or under‑billing.

### 4. Strategic Alignment – Educational Institution Context  

| Strategic Dimension      | Alignment Assessment |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Revenue Generation       | Directly supports operating cash flow and tuition‑based revenue targets. |
| Student Retention & Services | Timely fee processing ensures uninterrupted access to academic services. |
| Financial Sustainability | Consistent fee capture aligns with long‑term budgeting and capital planning. |
| Compliance & Reporting   | Accurate fee recording satisfies accreditation and regulatory reporting requirements. |

**Key Finding – Strategic Alignment** – The transaction, once posted, contributes positively to revenue objectives, student service continuity, and overall financial sustainability. No strategic conflict is identified.
